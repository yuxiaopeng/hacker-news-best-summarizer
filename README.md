## 1. Android开发者验证：抢先体验开始

**原文标题**: Android developer verification: Early access starts

**原文链接**: [https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/11/android-developer-verification-early.html](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/11/android-developer-verification-early.html)

In a November 12, 2025, Android Developers Blog post, Google announced the start of early access to its new Android developer verification requirements, designed to combat scams and malware. This initiative aims to enhance Android user safety by holding developers accountable for the software they distribute.

Google acknowledges feedback from students/hobbyists and power users, and is making adjustments to address their concerns. A dedicated account type will be created for students and hobbyists, allowing distribution to a limited number of devices without full verification. For experienced users with higher risk tolerance, Google is building an advanced flow to install unverified apps, including clear warnings about potential risks.

The verification process is crucial because scammers often use social engineering tactics to trick users into sideloading malicious apps, bypassing security warnings. Verification aims to disrupt this by requiring bad actors to use real identities, making it more difficult and costly to spread malware. Google highlights the success of verification on Google Play and aims to extend this to the broader Android ecosystem.

Early access to developer verification begins in the Android Developer Console for developers distributing outside of Play, with Play Console invites coming soon. Google encourages feedback to streamline the experience and emphasizes its commitment to working with developers to balance security and accessibility.
