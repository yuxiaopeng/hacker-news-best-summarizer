## 1. You should write an agent

**原文标题**: You should write an agent

Thomas Ptacek argues that writing LLM agents is surprisingly easy and valuable for understanding the technology, regardless of one's opinion on their ultimate utility. He demonstrates this by providing code snippets to create a simple ChatGPT-like engine and then extending it to include tools, allowing the agent to interact with the real world (e.g., pinging a host).

Ptacek emphasizes that an "agent" is essentially an LLM running in a loop, often utilizing tools. The context window, which is the history of interactions, is managed by the programmer, creating the illusion of a stateful conversation with a stateless LLM.

He critiques the overemphasis on "MCP" (plugin interfaces) in platforms like Claude Code, arguing that they abstract away control and security, and encourage developers to deal with APIs rather than plugins. He also downplays "Prompt Engineering," instead highlighting the importance of "Context Engineering," the strategic management of tokens within the context window.

Ptacek urges readers to experiment with agents, build their own tools, and explore different design choices like sub-agents. He highlights open engineering problems in agent design, such as balancing unpredictability with structured programming, connecting agents to ground truth, and facilitating multi-stage operations. He concludes that practical experience is crucial for understanding and forming informed opinions about this rapidly evolving technology.
