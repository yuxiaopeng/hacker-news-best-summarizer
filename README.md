## 1. I Am Mark Zuckerberg

**原文标题**: I Am Mark Zuckerberg

**原文链接**: [https://iammarkzuckerberg.com/](https://iammarkzuckerberg.com/)

This website, iammarkzuckerg.com, belongs to Mark S. Zuckerberg, an Indiana bankruptcy attorney, and *not* the famous founder of Facebook (Mark E. Zuckerberg). The site aims to clarify this common point of confusion and introduce visitors to the "original" Mark Zuckerberg of Indiana.

The site emphasizes that the Indiana Zuckerberg focuses on helping people with their finances, offering human-involved advice powered by coffee (instead of AI), and dealing with local legal questions, not tech scandals. He humorously acknowledges the daily mistaken identity and the absence of a shared fortune with the tech mogul.

The website highlights the many inconveniences the lawyer Zuckerberg has faced due to his name: mistaken identity lawsuits, constant hacking attempts on his Facebook accounts, forced account deactivations, inundation with calls and emails related to Facebook scams, daily tech support requests, constant friend requests, suggestions for Facebook improvements, death threats and harassment via Messenger, and Venmo solicitations. He was even kicked off the Nextdoor app for using a "fake name."

Despite the constant confusion and occasional harassment, the Indiana Zuckerberg maintains a good-natured approach. He vows to "rule the search" for "Mark Zuckerberg bankruptcy" and even jokingly offers to represent the Facebook founder should he ever need bankruptcy assistance in Indiana. The site encourages visitors to learn more about the "non-billionaire" Mark and emphasizes that "no login is required."
