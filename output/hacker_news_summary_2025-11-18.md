## 1. Cloudflare Global Network experiencing issues

**原文标题**: Cloudflare Global Network experiencing issues

**原文链接**: [https://www.cloudflarestatus.com/?t=1](https://www.cloudflarestatus.com/?t=1)

On November 18, 2025, Cloudflare experienced a global network service degradation, impacting several services and leading to intermittent errors and increased latency. The incident began around 11:48 UTC, prompting investigation and remediation efforts.

Cloudflare implemented a fix around 14:42 UTC, after which dashboard services were restored. The team continued to work on restoring broader application services. Specific updates mentioned the recovery of Cloudflare Access and WARP, with error rates returning to normal for those services. WARP access in London was temporarily disabled during remediation but later re-enabled.

By 17:44 UTC, Cloudflare services were operating normally, with errors and latency returning to usual levels. A post-incident investigation was planned to provide further details. Throughout the incident, the team actively monitored the system and worked to mitigate remaining issues. During the event, bot scores were intermittently impacted.

Scheduled maintenance was also underway in several datacenters, including HKG (Hong Kong), KUL (Kuala Lumpur), and ATL (Atlanta). This maintenance involved potential traffic re-routing and slight latency increases for affected end-users.

The status page also provides a detailed list of Cloudflare sites and services, categorizing them as operational or experiencing degraded performance. Several African and Asian locations were listed as experiencing partial outages or under maintenance.
