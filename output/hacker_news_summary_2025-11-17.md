## 1. AirPods libreated from Apple's ecosystem

**原文标题**: AirPods libreated from Apple's ecosystem

**原文链接**: [https://github.com/kavishdevar/librepods](https://github.com/kavishdevar/librepods)

LibrePods is an open-source project aiming to unlock the full potential of Apple AirPods on non-Apple devices, specifically Android and Linux. It grants access to features normally restricted to the Apple ecosystem, such as noise control modes, ear detection, battery status, and more advanced functionalities.

The project has varying degrees of support for different AirPods models, with the AirPods Pro 2nd and 3rd Gen being the most thoroughly tested. Features include customizable transparency mode, hearing aid configuration, multi-device connectivity, head gesture controls, and conversational awareness.

On Android, LibrePods generally requires a rooted device with Xposed due to limitations in the Android Bluetooth stack, although ColorOS/OxygenOS 16 users can access basic features without root. A Bluetooth DID hook can be enabled via Xposed to unlock advanced features by spoofing Apple device identification. This enables multi-device connectivity and accessibility settings like hearing aid customization.

The app allows renaming AirPods, customizing long-press actions, and adjusting other accessibility settings. Note that renaming AirPods requires re-pairing. Enabling the Apple device identification hook is necessary for full functionality. The project is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.
