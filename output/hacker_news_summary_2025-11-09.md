## 1. I Am Mark Zuckerberg

**原文标题**: I Am Mark Zuckerberg

**原文链接**: [https://iammarkzuckerberg.com/](https://iammarkzuckerberg.com/)

This website belongs to Mark S. Zuckerberg, a bankruptcy attorney in Indiana, and *not* the founder of Facebook (Meta). The site serves as a humorous and informative introduction, distinguishing him from his more famous namesake while highlighting his professional services.

Zuckerberg emphasizes he helps people with financial difficulties, offering personal legal advice unlike the tech support or financial assistance seekers who frequently mistake him for the tech billionaire. He highlights the absurd daily realities of sharing a name with Mark Zuckerberg, detailing instances of mistaken identity, social media account issues, and unwanted attention.

He lists numerous inconveniences he faces, including being sued due to mistaken identity, frequent account suspensions, constant hacking attempts, an overwhelming number of notifications, and the need to provide extensive identification to prove his identity to Facebook. He's also been inundated with calls, emails, friend requests, and even packages meant for the Facebook founder, dealing with everything from complaints and suggestions for Facebook to demands for tech support.

Furthermore, he recounts being kicked off the Nextdoor app, receiving death threats on Messenger intended for the other Zuckerberg, and getting random Venmo requests. Despite the challenges, he maintains a good-natured approach, jokingly vying to dominate the search results for "Mark Zuckerberg bankruptcy" and offering his services should the real Mark Zuckerberg ever need them in Indiana. The site's goal is to clarify his identity, offer his legal services, and provide a lighthearted look at the unique situation he finds himself in.

## 2. YouTube Removes Windows 11 Bypass Tutorials, Claims 'Risk of Physical Harm'

**原文标题**: YouTube Removes Windows 11 Bypass Tutorials, Claims 'Risk of Physical Harm'

**原文链接**: [https://news.itsfoss.com/youtube-removes-windows-11-bypass-tutorials/](https://news.itsfoss.com/youtube-removes-windows-11-bypass-tutorials/)

The article details how YouTube removed two Windows 11 tutorial videos from the CyberCPU Tech channel, citing that they "encouraged dangerous or illegal activities that risk serious physical harm or death." The videos showed how to install Windows 11 with a local account and how to bypass hardware requirements on unsupported systems. Both videos received community guideline strikes, and initial appeals were quickly denied.

The YouTuber, Rich, initially suspected automated moderation or potential involvement from Microsoft. The key issue is the incongruity between the content of the videos (Windows installation tutorials) and YouTube's claim that they posed a "risk of death."

YouTube eventually restored the videos, admitting that its "initial actions" were not automated, raising questions about how human reviewers could misinterpret the tutorials as dangerous. The article emphasizes the problem of automated moderation systems struggling to understand context and flagging harmless content as harmful. It contrasts this with the prevalence of actual spam that often goes unnoticed. The author argues for more human oversight in content moderation, suggesting that automation should assist, but not replace, human judgment. The article also references similar incidents, such as the removal of Enderman's personal channel and the deletion of the It's FOSS News Telegram community, highlighting a broader issue with content moderation on Big Tech platforms.

## 3. I Want You to Understand Chicago

**原文标题**: I Want You to Understand Chicago

**原文链接**: [https://aphyr.com/posts/397-i-want-you-to-understand-chicago](https://aphyr.com/posts/397-i-want-you-to-understand-chicago)

The article "I Want You to Understand Chicago" paints a harrowing picture of life in Chicago under an increased federal presence, ostensibly targeting immigration enforcement. The author details numerous instances of alleged abuse and overreach by ICE and CBP agents, creating a climate of fear and distrust.

The author describes everyday life as punctuated by reports of kidnappings, assaults, and detentions, highlighting specific incidents involving community members, clergy, elected officials, and ordinary citizens. Federal agents are accused of using excessive force, including tear gas and pepper balls, against civilians, even children and the elderly, often without warning or justification. They are also accused of operating without warrants and violating court orders.

The author emphasizes the government's alleged misinformation and lack of accountability, citing instances of officials lying and dismissing concerns about the use of force. Judge Ellis is quoted as calling the government's evidence "not credible" and finding their use of force "shocks the conscience."

The author calls for understanding the historical dangers of a secret police and the potential erosion of democracy when a militia is deployed against its own people. They warn that unchecked, the mandate of these forces will grow, threatening civil liberties.

Despite the grim reality, the author also highlights the resilience and solidarity of the Chicago community, detailing acts of mutual aid, resistance, and defense against the perceived injustices. They emphasize the efforts of neighbors, elected officials, and journalists to protect and support one another in the face of adversity, showcasing the spirit of Chicago.
