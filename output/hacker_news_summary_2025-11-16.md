## 1. Our investigation into the suspicious pressure on Archive.today

**原文标题**: Our investigation into the suspicious pressure on Archive.today

**原文链接**: [https://adguard-dns.io/en/blog/archive-today-adguard-dns-block-demand.html](https://adguard-dns.io/en/blog/archive-today-adguard-dns-block-demand.html)

This article details AdGuard DNS's investigation into suspicious pressure exerted on Archive.today, a website that archives snapshots of web pages. AdGuard was contacted by the Web Abuse Association Defense (WAAD), a newly formed French organization, demanding they block Archive.today due to alleged refusal to remove illegal content, specifically CSAM. WAAD threatened legal action under French law (LCEN).

Suspicious of WAAD's legitimacy, AdGuard contacted Archive.today, who promptly removed the reported content and stated they'd received no prior notifications. Archive.today suggested a coordinated campaign of complaints aimed at harming the site.

AdGuard's investigation revealed several red flags about WAAD: a recently registered organization with minimal public information, a generic registration address, and a new, inactive Twitter account. Furthermore, WAAD's claim of correspondence with Archive.today dating back to 2023 was contradicted by the dates of the "bailiff reports" they provided, most of which were created in August 2025. The earlier reports were ordered by someone whose name appeared in Archive.today's shared complaint, potentially indicating impersonation.

AdGuard concludes that the complaints against Archive.today are highly suspicious, originating from an organization seemingly designed to conceal its operators. Citing the French LCEN law's penalties for false reports, AdGuard plans to file a complaint with French police. The article also notes the FBI's ongoing investigation into Archive.today, speculated to be related to CSAM hosting, adding to the concerning situation.

## 3. AirPods libreated from Apple's ecosystem

**原文标题**: AirPods libreated from Apple's ecosystem

**原文链接**: [https://github.com/kavishdevar/librepods](https://github.com/kavishdevar/librepods)

LibrePods is a project aimed at unlocking the full potential of Apple's AirPods on non-Apple devices, specifically Android and Linux. It allows users to access features normally restricted to the Apple ecosystem, such as noise control modes, ear detection, battery status, head gestures, conversational awareness, hearing aid functionality, and customized transparency mode.

On Android, LibrePods requires a rooted device with Xposed due to limitations in the Android Bluetooth stack. A "Device Identification" (DID) hook, changing the manufacturer ID to Apple's, enables additional features like multi-device connectivity (up to two devices) and accessibility settings.  Android users can also customize transparency settings and configure hearing aid features, utilizing pre-existing audiogram data.

The Linux version runs as a system tray app, providing battery monitoring, ear detection, conversational awareness, noise control mode switching, and device renaming.

The project highlights compatibility, with AirPods Pro (2nd Gen) fully supported and AirPods Pro (3rd Gen) mostly supported. Basic features should work with other AirPods models. The software is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.
