    "summary": "\"Antirender\" is a concept or tool aimed at stripping away the \"glossy shine\" from architectural renderings. Its stated purpose is to \"See Through The Architectural BS,\" implying that the typical highly polished and idealized renderings often misrepresent the reality of proposed projects.\n\nBy removing this artificial sheen, Antirender seeks to provide a more truthful, grounded, and less embellished view of architectural designs. It acts as a critical filter, allowing observers to bypass marketing hype and overly optimistic portrayals to gain a more realistic understanding of what a building or project would genuinely look like, encouraging a more honest assessment of architectural proposals.",

    "chinese_summary": "\"Antirender\"是一个旨在剥离建筑效果图\"光鲜亮丽外衣\"的概念或工具。其宣称的目的是\"看穿建筑行业的浮夸之处\"，这意味着典型的、高度美化和理想化的效果图常常歪曲了拟建项目的真实面貌。\n\n通过去除这种人工的修饰，Antirender旨在提供一个更真实、更扎实、更朴实无华的建筑设计视角。它充当了一个批判性的过滤器，使观察者能够绕过市场炒作和过于乐观的描绘，从而对一个建筑或项目真正会是什么样子有一个更切实的了解，并鼓励对建筑方案进行更诚实的评估。"

The new name emphasizes its open-source, community-driven nature while retaining its \"lobster heritage.\"\n\nOpenClaw is an open agent platform that runs directly on your machine (laptop, homelab, or VPS), integrating with existing chat apps like WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, and Teams. A key principle is user data sovereignty: \"Your assistant. Your machine. Your rules,\" ensuring data remains private and on the user's infrastructure, unlike SaaS alternatives.\n\nThis rebrand release includes significant updates:\n*   **New Channels:** Twitch and Google Chat plugins.\n*   **Model Support:** Added KIMI K2.5 and Xiaomi MiMo-V2-Flash.\n*   **Web Chat:** Now supports sending images.\n*   **Security:** Features 34 new security commits and machine-checkable security models, with ongoing efforts to harden the codebase.\n\nLooking forward, OpenClaw's top priorities are continued security, gateway reliability, and expanding support for more models and providers. The creator, Peter, is also scaling the team by adding and compensating maintainers, encouraging community contributions and sponsorships. The project's lobster mascot remains.",

    "summary": "In 2026, European firms are increasingly prioritizing digital sovereignty, leading to a shift away from US-based cloud providers. The author, an American, expresses distrust in US companies under the current \"Trump-redux\" government regarding data security. This isn't mere compliance, but a national economic security imperative.\n\nEuropean CIOs are responding to geopolitical concerns, with 61% planning to increase reliance on local cloud providers. While US hyperscalers like AWS are offering \"European Sovereign Cloud\" options, critics like CISPE view this as \"Euro-washing,\" arguing these solutions still fall under US legal jurisdiction. The core issue is the US CLOUD Act and other surveillance statutes, which compel US-headquartered providers to hand over European data regardless of its physical location. Microsoft, for instance, has admitted it cannot guarantee data independence from US law enforcement.\n\nThe article posits a hypothetical scenario where a US government decision could unilaterally cut off services to the EU, highlighting the danger of Europe's over 90% dependency on US cloud infrastructure. Companies like Airbus are already taking action, investing €50 million to migrate mission-critical applications to a \"sovereign European cloud\" rooted in EU law and operated by EU entities.\n\nBrussels is fostering an open-source-led exit from hyperscaler lock-in, promoting solutions like Nextcloud over Microsoft 365, and encouraging local services. For sensitive data, national security, or industrial IP, EU-native cloud and services are presented not as a preference, but as an essential business continuity requirement. The message is clear: it's time for Europe to get serious about digital sovereignty and detach from US cloud reliance.",

    "chinese_summary": "2026年，欧洲企业日益将数字主权放在首位，这导致它们逐渐放弃使用美国云服务提供商。作者作为一名美国人，对当前“特朗普再临”政府下的美国公司在数据安全方面的表现表示不信任。这不仅仅是为了合规，更是一项国家经济安全的需求。\n\n欧洲首席信息官们正在应对地缘政治担忧，其中61%计划增加对本地云服务提供商的依赖。尽管AWS等美国超大规模云服务商正在提供“欧洲主权云”选项，但CISPE等批评者认为这是一种“欧洲洗白”，他们争辩说这些解决方案仍受美国法律管辖。核心问题在于美国《云法案》(CLOUD Act)及其他监控法规，这些法规强制美国总部设在的服务提供商交出欧洲数据，无论这些数据实际位于何处。例如，微软已经承认它无法保证数据独立于美国执法部门。\n\n文章提出了一个假设场景：美国政府的一项决定可能单方面切断对欧盟的服务，这突显了欧洲对美国云基础设施超过90%的依赖所带来的危险。空客等公司已经采取行动，投资5000万欧元将其关键任务应用程序迁移到一个植根于欧盟法律并由欧盟实体运营的“欧洲主权云”。\n\n布鲁塞尔正在推动一场由开源主导的摆脱超大规模云服务商锁定效应的行动，推广Nextcloud而非Microsoft 365等解决方案，并鼓励本地服务。对于敏感数据、国家安全或工业知识产权，欧盟本土云和服务的提供不再是一种偏好，而是必要的业务连续性要求。信息很明确：欧洲是时候认真对待数字主权，并摆脱对美国云服务的依赖了。"
