    "url": "https://www.ftm.eu/articles/europe-health-data-us-firm-israel-spies",
    "summary": "The European confidential messaging service Zivver, used by EU and U.K. governments, hospitals, and courts for sensitive communications, has been sold to the American company Kiteworks, sparking significant concerns among experts. The deal places highly sensitive European data under U.S. legal jurisdiction, regardless of where it's stored.\n\nA primary concern is Kiteworks' leadership: its CEO and several top executives are veterans of Unit 8200, an elite Israeli Defence Force cyber unit renowned for eavesdropping and code-breaking. This strong link to Israeli intelligence has led experts to believe there's a high probability of data flowing to Israel, making European communications vulnerable.\n\nAdding to these worries, an investigation revealed that Zivver, contrary to its marketing claims of \"zero access,\" can technically read the content of its users' supposedly encrypted messages and attachments, at least briefly during transmission. This means sensitive information—including medical, financial, and personal data—is accessible to the company itself, and now its new U.S. owner with deep intelligence ties. Experts deem this information a \"goldmine\" for intelligence agencies, usable for surveillance or coercion.\n\nThe acquisition proceeded without scrutiny from Dutch authorities, who controversially classified Zivver as non-\"critical infrastructure.\" Experts condemn this oversight as a \"huge blunder,\" highlighting Europe's lack of strategic control over its digital infrastructure. The case underscores geopolitical tensions and the dangers of entrusting sensitive European data to foreign entities with intelligence connections.",
    "chinese_title": "欧洲人的健康数据被出售给由前以色列间谍经营的美国公司。",
    "chinese_summary": "欧盟和英国政府、医院及法院用于敏感通信的欧洲保密消息服务Zivver已出售给美国公司Kiteworks，引发了专家们的重大担忧。这笔交易将高度敏感的欧洲数据置于美国法律管辖之下，无论数据存储在哪里。\n\n一个主要担忧是Kiteworks的领导层：其首席执行官和几位高级管理人员均是以窃听和破译密码而闻名的以色列国防军精锐网络部队——8200部队的退役成员。这种与以色列情报部门的紧密联系使专家们相信数据很有可能流向以色列，从而使欧洲的通信变得脆弱。\n\n更令人担忧的是，一项调查显示，Zivver声称的“零访问”与事实不符，它在技术上能够读取用户所谓加密消息和附件的内容，至少在传输过程中可以短暂访问。这意味着敏感信息——包括医疗、金融和个人数据——可以被公司本身访问，现在也可以被其具有深厚情报背景的美国新东家访问。专家们认为这些信息对情报机构来说是“金矿”，可用于监视或胁迫。\n\n这次收购在未经荷兰当局审查的情况下进行，荷兰当局有争议地将Zivver归类为非“关键基础设施”。专家们谴责这一疏忽是“巨大失误”，凸显了欧洲对其数字基础设施缺乏战略控制。此案凸显了地缘政治紧张局势，以及将敏感的欧洲数据委托给具有情报背景的外国实体的危险。"

    "url": "https://english.elpais.com/technology/2025-11-30/if-ai-replaces-workers-should-it-also-pay-taxes.html",
    "summary": "The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and automation poses a significant challenge to public finances as it potentially displaces human workers, leading to reduced income tax and social security contributions. This has sparked a debate: should AI or the companies that deploy it pay taxes to compensate for lost labor revenue?\n\nProponents of taxing AI, like Bill Gates and Nobel laureate Edmund Phelps, suggest applying tax burdens similar to those borne by human workers. However, many experts and organizations, including the IMF, generally advise against a specific AI tax due to difficulties in definition, potential market distortions, and stifling innovation.\n\nInstead, alternative solutions are proposed:\n*   **Increased capital gains taxation:** Recommended by Sanjay Patnaik of the Brookings Institution and the IMF, as capital taxes have decreased while labor taxes remained high.\n*   **Supplementary taxes on \"excessive\" corporate profits:** Suggested by the IMF.\n*   **Reviewing tax incentives** for innovation and intangible assets.\n*   **Addressing tax system imbalance:** Carl Frey of Oxford University notes that lower capital taxes compared to income taxes incentivize automation over job creation.\n\nCritics, like Daniel Waldenström and Susanne Bieller of the International Federation of Robotics, argue that a specific AI tax is unnecessary, difficult to implement, and could harm competitiveness. They highlight that automation can create new jobs and boost productivity, and that current unemployment rates haven't significantly risen.\n\nWhile AI is forecasted to boost global GDP, the impact on employment remains uncertain; many jobs may be transformed rather than eliminated, but higher-skilled roles are increasingly exposed. Concerns also include growing inequality, high energy consumption, and the risk that new job creation may not automatically offset losses, particularly for less-skilled workers. The article concludes that active policy choices are crucial to navigate these complex social and economic impacts.",
    "chinese_title": "如果AI取代工人，它是否也应该纳税？",
    "chinese_summary": "人工智能（AI）和自动化技术的兴起对公共财政构成了重大挑战，因为它可能取代人类工人，导致所得税和社会保障缴款减少。这引发了一场争论：人工智能或部署人工智能的公司是否应该纳税，以弥补劳动力收入的损失？\n\n支持对人工智能征税的人士，如比尔·盖茨和诺贝尔经济学奖得主埃德蒙·费尔普斯，建议施加与人类工人承担的税负类似的税收。然而，包括国际货币基金组织（IMF）在内的许多专家和机构普遍不建议征收特定的人工智能税，理由是其定义困难、可能扭曲市场并抑制创新。\n\n相反，有人提出了替代解决方案：\n*   **增加资本利得税：** 由布鲁金斯学会的桑杰·帕特奈克和国际货币基金组织推荐，因为资本税有所下降，而劳动税仍居高不下。\n*   **对“超额”公司利润征收附加税：** 由国际货币基金组织提出。\n*   **审查创新和无形资产的税收优惠。**\n*   **解决税收系统失衡问题：** 牛津大学的卡尔·弗雷指出，与所得税相比，较低的资本税激励了自动化而非创造就业。\n\n批评者，如国际机器人联合会的丹尼尔·瓦尔登斯特伦和苏珊娜·比勒，认为征收特定的人工智能税是不必要、难以实施且可能损害竞争力的。他们强调，自动化可以创造新工作并提高生产力，而且当前的失业率并未显著上升。\n\n虽然人工智能预计将提振全球GDP，但其对就业的影响仍不确定；许多工作岗位可能被转型而非淘汰，但高技能岗位也日益面临风险。担忧还包括日益加剧的不平等、高能耗，以及新创造的就业岗位可能无法自动弥补损失（特别是对于低技能工人）的风险。文章总结指出，积极的政策选择对于应对这些复杂的社会和经济影响至关重要。"

    "url": "https://borretti.me/article/hashcards-plain-text-spaced-repetition",
    "summary": "Hashcards is a new, local-first spaced repetition system that distinguishes itself by not using a database. Instead, it stores flashcards as plain-text Markdown files, with simple syntax for question/answer (`Q:/A:`) and cloze deletions (`C: [text]`). It uses the advanced FSRS scheduling algorithm, storing review history in a local SQLite database.\n\nThis design offers significant benefits: users can edit cards with any text editor, manage collections with Git for version control and sharing, and generate cards programmatically from structured data using scripts. This provides a strong sense of ownership and flexibility, addressing the author's dissatisfaction with existing apps.\n\nThe author found Anki's interface \"ugly\" and unintuitive, with cumbersome WYSIWYG editing and janky plugins. Mochi offered a better interface and Markdown support but suffered from verbose cloze syntax, lacked Anki's powerful \"note types\" for automated card generation, and historically used a less effective scheduling algorithm, leading to long-term retention issues.\n\nHashcards prioritizes frictionless card creation through its simple, low-friction text format, minimizing typing and easing editing. By embracing plain-text files and leveraging standard Unix tools and Git, Hashcards allows users to customize workflows, generate cards via scripts (effectively replacing Anki's note types), and provides a highly adaptable and maintainable system for knowledge acquisition.",

The 78-year-old, founder of the now-defunct Apple Daily newspaper, pleaded not guilty but faces life in prison, with sentencing expected early next year.\n\nThe court found Lai guilty of using Apple Daily to lobby foreign governments for sanctions against Hong Kong and China, and for expressing \"hatred\" for the PRC. Lai denied influencing foreign policy, stating he only relayed information or asked for vocal support. He was a prominent critic of Beijing and a key figure in Hong Kong's 2019 pro-democracy protests.\n\nThe verdict has drawn strong international condemnation, with rights groups and Western governments, including the UK and US, labeling it a \"cruel judicial farce\" and \"politically motivated persecution.\" They called for Lai's release and the repeal of the NSL. Hong Kong Chief Executive John Lee welcomed the verdict, while China dismissed the criticism.\n\nLai's trial is seen as a significant test of Hong Kong's judicial independence, with critics highlighting the NSL's near 100% conviction rate and issues like the denial of bail and his choice of foreign lawyer. Lai's son has urged the UK government to prioritize his father's release. Lai, who became an activist after the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, is widely seen as a leading voice for democracy in Hong Kong.",

It distinguishes between the two: memory safety prevents internal program bugs, while sandboxing restricts a program's capabilities, even if it's memory-safe.

OpenSSH's Linux sandbox utilizes `chroot`, unprivileged user/group execution, `setrlimit` (resource limits), and `seccomp-BPF` (syscall filtering).\n\nWhile `chroot` and user/group restrictions work seamlessly with Fil-C, `setrlimit` and `seccomp-BPF` require special handling due to Fil-C's multithreaded runtime.
