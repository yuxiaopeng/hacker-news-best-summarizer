    "summary": "The author, fed up with Windows' constant upsells, AI features, and perceived lack of user control, has fully embraced Linux. They highlight a personal journey, initially driven by frustration with Windows feeling like a \"rental,\" despite building their own PC.\n\nContrary to common misconceptions, the author found Linux surprisingly easy to use, particularly with gaming-focused distros like Bazzite. They note that everything played on Linux has been as easy, or easier, to run than on Windows, attributing this to the maturation of mainstream Linux distros. The article also mentions a Debian-powered media server requiring \"zero input,\" showcasing Linux's reliability for everyday tasks and its freedom from unwanted pre-installed software like Edge.\n\nThe author points to a growing trend, citing Steam's hardware survey showing Linux users hitting a new high of 3.2% (surpassing Mac players). They argue that gaming on Linux, often via Valve's Proton compatibility layer, can even outperform Windows in some cases. While acknowledging lingering issues like HDR inconsistency and anti-cheat software compatibility in some live-service games, the author believes these are gradually improving.\n\nUltimately, the article recommends giving Linux a try by 2026, suggesting it offers a more \"hospitable\" and empowering computing experience, freeing users from corporate control over their own hardware.",
    "chinese_title": "Linux 现在很好",
    "chinese_summary": "作者因厌倦了Windows的持续推销、AI功能以及其所认为的用户控制权缺失，已完全转向Linux。他们强调这是一个个人历程，最初的动力是尽管自己组装了电脑，却对Windows感觉像“租用”系统而感到沮丧。\n\n与普遍的误解相反，作者发现Linux出奇地易用，尤其是在Bazzite这类以游戏为主的发行版上。他们指出，在Linux上运行所有游戏都和Windows一样简单，甚至更简单，这归因于主流Linux发行版的成熟。文章还提到一个由Debian驱动的媒体服务器“零输入”运行，展示了Linux在日常任务中的可靠性，以及它免受Edge等不必要的预装软件困扰的优点。\n\n作者指出了一种增长趋势，援引Steam硬件调查显示Linux用户达到了3.2%的新高（超过了Mac玩家）。他们认为，通过Valve的Proton兼容层，Linux上的游戏体验在某些情况下甚至可以超越Windows。尽管承认在一些在线服务游戏中存在HDR不一致和反作弊软件兼容性等挥之不去的问题，作者相信这些问题正在逐步改善。\n\n最终，文章建议在2026年前尝试Linux，认为它提供了一种更“友好”和赋能的计算体验，将用户从企业对其自身硬件的控制中解放出来。"

    "url": "https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/31/the-year-in-llms/",
    "summary": "2025 was a landmark year for LLMs, marked by significant advancements across multiple fronts. The \"Year of Reasoning\" saw models like OpenAI's o1-o4 mini and DeepSeek R1 leverage Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to develop sophisticated problem-solving strategies, excelling at tool-use, AI-assisted search, and code debugging.\n\nThis intelligence fueled the \"Year of Agents,\" particularly \"coding agents\" exemplified by Anthropic's Claude Code. These systems could write, execute, and iterate on code, available as both command-line tools and asynchronous web platforms like Claude Code for web and OpenAI's Codex Cloud. The impressive revenue generated by these CLI agents ($1bn for Claude Code) underscored their utility, though running them in \"YOLO mode\" (automatic confirmation) highlighted security concerns related to the \"Normalization of Deviance.\"\n\nFinancially, a new trend emerged with \"$200/month subscriptions\" (e.g., Claude Pro Max 20x, ChatGPT Pro), catering to heavy users. A major development was the rise of \"top-ranked Chinese open-weight models\" like DeepSeek, Qwen, Kimi, and GLM. Often released under open-source licenses, these models became world-beaters, even impacting global markets and pushing the state-of-the-art in efficient training.\n\nLLMs also made dramatic progress in handling \"long tasks,\" with models like GPT-5 and Claude Opus 4.5 capable of completing complex, multi-hour software engineering challenges. The year also saw the highly successful launch of a \"prompt-driven image editing\" consumer product.",

    "url": "https://henry.codes/writing/a-website-to-destroy-all-websites/",
    "summary": "The article, \"A website to destroy all websites,\" argues that the internet has devolved from a \"vast, holy realm of self-discovery and joy\" into a negative space dominated by \"attention-farm\" content, social media traps, and industrial-scale web development. The author contrasts the past internet—where learning from experts, forming genuine friendships, and creative coding flourished—with the present, characterized by AI-generated content, advertising overload, and uninspiring web engineering.\n\nDrawing on Ivan Illich's \"Tools for Conviviality,\" the piece frames this decline as a common pattern: technology initially enhances human freedom but then becomes industrialized, creating \"radical monopolies\" where societies serve tools, rather than the other way around. Examples include the automobile, textile industry, antibiotics, and space exploration. The Web, similarly, has become a system designed to extract capital and attention, leading to problems like misinformation and addiction.\n\nThe solution, according to Illich's framework, lies in \"convivial tools\"—sustainable, autonomy-enhancing, and local-first technologies. Applied to the internet, this means:\n*   **Teaching & Learning:** Reverting to personal blogs (HTML, RSS) instead of monolithic platforms like YouTube or Substack, to regain content ownership and foster genuine intellectual exchange.\n*   **Connecting with Friends:** Building personal social networks using decentralized protocols (POSSE, ActivityPub) to create durable, owner-controlled communities free from corporate whims.\n*   **Coding for the Web:** Reclaiming web engineering as a creative craft through HTML, CSS, and progressively enhanced JavaScript, encouraging experimentation over industrial production.\n\nUltimately, the article concludes that the answer to reclaiming the internet is the **personal website**. Hand-coded, syndicated, and deeply individual, these sites embody autonomy, ownership, and creative expression, offering a powerful alternative to the industrialized, \"bad\" internet.",
    "chinese_title": "毁灭所有网站的网站",
    "chinese_summary": "文章《一个可以摧毁所有网站的网站》指出，互联网已经从一个“广阔、神圣的自我发现与愉悦之地”退化成一个负面空间，充斥着“注意力农场”式内容、社交媒体陷阱以及工业规模的网页开发。作者将过去那个专家教学、真挚友谊和创意编程蓬勃发展的互联网，与现在这个充斥着AI生成内容、广告泛滥和缺乏灵感的网页工程的互联网进行了对比。\n\n该文借鉴伊万·伊里奇的《共生工具论》，将这种衰落描述为一种普遍模式：技术最初提升人类自由，但随后工业化，形成“激进垄断”，导致社会反过来服务于工具。汽车、纺织业、抗生素和太空探索都是例证。同样，万维网也演变成一个旨在榨取资本和注意力的系统，从而引发虚假信息和成瘾等问题。\n\n根据伊里奇的框架，解决方案在于“共生工具”——即可持续的、增强自主性的和本地优先的技术。应用于互联网，这意味着：\n*   **教与学：** 摒弃YouTube或Substack等大型一体化平台，回归个人博客（HTML、RSS），以重获内容所有权并促进真正的思想交流。\n*   **与朋友联系：** 使用去中心化协议（POSSE、ActivityPub）构建个人社交网络，以创建持久的、由所有者控制的、不受公司左右的社区。\n*   **为万维网编程：** 通过HTML、CSS和渐进增强的JavaScript，将网页工程重新塑造成一项创意工艺，鼓励实验而非工业化生产。\n\n最终，文章总结道，重塑互联网的关键在于**个人网站**。这些手工编码、可联合发布、高度个性化的网站，体现了自主性、所有权和创意表达，为工业化、“糟糕”的互联网提供了一个有力的替代方案。"

    "summary": "Warren Buffett has stepped down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway after 60 years, handing control of the $1-trillion conglomerate to Greg Abel. Buffett, 95, will remain chairman, continuing daily office visits to spot investments and advise Abel.\n\nAbel, who has managed Berkshire’s non-insurance operations since 2018, faces challenges including slowing growth and pressure to deploy the company's $382-billion cash pile. Under Buffett, Berkshire grew from a struggling textile mill into a diverse empire, often outperforming the S&P 500 with holdings like Geico, BNSF, and Apple.\n\nWhile no seismic shifts are expected, Abel, known for a more hands-on style, will likely introduce some changes. He recently appointed Adam Johnson to manage consumer, service, and retail businesses, creating a new division. Abel is committed to maintaining Berkshire's decentralized culture, granting autonomy to subsidiary executives, a principle championed by the late Charlie Munger.\n\nAnalysts suggest Abel may adopt a more traditional leadership approach. He will eventually face investor pressure to initiate dividends or regular stock buybacks if the cash pile isn't effectively reinvested, though Buffett's significant voting power currently provides insulation. Despite recent leadership changes, including investment manager Todd Combs' departure, investors remain optimistic about Berkshire's future under Abel, citing its solid foundation.",

Only once a discussion evolves into a well-understood, actionable item is it converted into an Issue by a maintainer. This approach ensures that every item in the issue tracker is ready for development, making it more efficient for contributors.\n\nThe maintainers note that a high percentage (80-90%) of user-reported \"bugs\" are typically misunderstandings, environmental issues, or configuration errors. The majority of the rest are often underspecified feature requests. By filtering these through discussions first, the team can provide guidance and refine submissions.\n\nUsers who identify a valid, reproducible problem will have their Discussion converted into an Issue by a maintainer, ensuring no extra work on their part for confirmed problems.

    "summary": "Austin Z. Henley, an Associate Teaching Professor at Carnegie Mellon University, recounts his journey of canceling a book deal after signing with a major publisher in early 2023. Initially intrigued by the opportunity to write a book on classic programming projects, a goal he long harbored, he weighed the pros and cons of traditional publishing. While publishers offered structure and distribution, Henley found the financial terms (low advance, royalties) unappealing and noted their minimal marketing efforts.\n\nThe collaboration quickly soured due to conflicting visions. The publisher repeatedly pushed him to \"dumb down\" the content, suppress his personal voice, and incorporate an introductory Python chapter, reflecting a formulaic approach. A significant point of friction was the publisher's insistence on integrating AI into every book, which Henley firmly declined as it contradicted his book's premise of timeless, fundamental projects.\n\nProject delays mounted due to his demanding job and personal life events, including his wedding. Henley grew increasingly frustrated with the process, finding it a chore rather than a motivator, and began questioning the book's relevance in the age of LLMs. Misaligned expectations with technical editors, who critiqued his projects as if they were production-quality software, added to his dissatisfaction.\n\nUltimately, overwhelmed and no longer enjoying the process, Henley requested to freeze the project. The publisher eventually terminated the contract, returning all rights to him. Despite the challenges, Henley remains passionate about his book idea and has decided to self-publish, offering an e-book for pre-order with chapters released as they are completed.",

The developer expresses deep guilt and helplessness regarding the company's practices.\n\nKey issues highlighted include:\n*   **Low Pay:** Drivers are paid extremely poorly, often earning below minimum wage once expenses like gas and vehicle maintenance are factored in. Longer distances are particularly underpaid.\n*   **Batched Orders:** The app frequently combines multiple orders for a single driver, yet the pay increase is marginal, forcing drivers to do significantly more work for disproportionately little extra compensation, despite customers paying individual delivery fees.\n*   **Unfair Rating System:** Drivers can be deactivated if their customer ratings drop too low, even when factors outside their control, such as restaurant delays or food quality, influence the score.\n*   **Lack of Support:** When problems occur (e.g., wrong addresses, late cancellations), drivers bear the brunt, often losing time, gas, and pay without compensation. Customer support frequently sides against the driver.\n*   **Independent Contractor Status:** Drivers are classified as independent contractors, denying them benefits, minimum wage protections, and job security.\n\nThe developer feels complicit in creating features that perpetuate this exploitative system but is powerless to change the underlying business model due to their own need for employment.",
