    "summary": "\"This Week in F-Droid\" (TWIF) raises an urgent alarm regarding Google's uncancelled plans to lock down Android. F-Droid notes a public misconception that these plans were abandoned, asserting that the initiatives announced last August are still on track, threatening to make Google the \"gate-keeper\" of user devices.\n\nTo counter this, F-Droid has begun featuring warning banners in its F-Droid and F-Droid Basic clients, encouraging users to contact local authorities. Other app downloaders like IzzyOnDroid and Obtainium are joining this effort.\n\nDevelopment for F-Droid Basic continues, with release 2.0-alpha3 introducing features like updated translations, CSV export of installed apps, install history, a mirror chooser, and Material Design 3 adaptations.\n\nKey app updates include Conversations and Quicksy exploring a method to interface directly with Google Play Services, aiming for fully FLOSS versions compatible with both F-Droid and Play Store. Dolphin Emulator received substantial updates, Image Toolbox added AI tools, and ProtonVPN transitioned entirely to WireGuard and Stealth protocols, reducing app size. Offi now requires Android 8+, and SimpleEmail saw a fix-focused update after a two-year pause.\n\nLastly, the report lists 5 apps that were removed and 1 new app, NeoDB You, that was added, alongside updates for 287 other applications.",

    "summary": "After the US Supreme Court reportedly struck down his global tariffs, President Trump announced new tariffs, notably a \"NEW 15% TAX\" on the American people, drawing immediate and varied reactions from lawmakers.\n\nDemocrat Congressman Ted Lieu criticized Trump, stating he \"feels hurt\" by the Supreme Court ruling and is retaliating against Americans with \"temporary tariffs\" that Democrats plan to challenge and eventually eliminate. California Governor Gavin Newsom echoed this, calling the 15% tax a burden on Americans and suggesting Trump's disregard for their well-being.\n\nIn a more nuanced stance, Democratic Senator John Fetterman expressed an \"open mind\" about tariffs. He supports using them against China and urged Trump to collaborate with lawmakers but questioned the imposition of tariffs on US allies. Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune generally affirmed tariffs as an \"important and effective tool\" for fair competition with foreign nations.",

Many posts were clearly AI-generated, with obvious errors, yet comments often failed to acknowledge this, suggesting potential bot activity.\n\nThe author questioned if this was an anomaly due to their long inactivity but suspected it reflected a broader decline in Facebook's content, potentially worse for lonely users. They contrasted this pervasive \"slop\" on the *main feed* with spam issues on other platforms. The final straw was encountering AI-generated images that appeared to depict girls around 14 years old, prompting the author to immediately log off, vowing to only return if absolutely necessary for essential updates.",

    "summary": "The author, seeking LinkedIn's blue verification badge, discovered the process is handled by Persona Identities, Inc., a US company. For a three-minute verification, Persona collects extensive personal data, including full name, passport photo, selfie, facial geometry (biometrics), NFC chip data, national ID, email, phone, address, device information, geolocation, and even behavioral biometrics like hesitation detection.\n\nPersona also cross-references users against government databases, credit agencies, and utility companies. Crucially, it uses uploaded identity documents and selfies to train its AI, citing \"legitimate interests\" rather than user consent. While LinkedIn receives limited data, Persona shares the full data with 17 subprocessors—16 US-based (including AI companies like Anthropic and OpenAI, and AWS) and one Canadian—with no EU subprocessors.\n\nThis means European users' data, even if stored in Germany, is subject to the US CLOUD Act, allowing US law enforcement to demand it regardless of server location, potentially under gag orders. The EU-US Data Privacy Framework is deemed fragile, based on a revocable Executive Order. The author emphasizes the risk of unchangeable biometric data being held indefinitely by US legal mandates. Persona’s terms cap liability for breaches at $50 and enforce US arbitration.\n\nThe author advises existing verified users to request and delete their data from Persona and contact their DPO to object to AI training, cautioning others to weigh the value of a cosmetic badge against profound personal data exposure.",

    "summary": "A platform engineer and diving instructor discovered a critical vulnerability in a major diving insurer's member portal. The system used sequential numeric user IDs combined with a static default password, which was never enforced to be changed, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive personal data, including that of minors, without rate limiting or MFA.\n\nFollowing standard responsible disclosure protocols, the researcher notified CSIRT Malta and the organization on April 28, 2025, proposing a 30-day embargo. The organization acknowledged the issue, initiated password resets, and planned 2FA rollout. However, their response quickly turned hostile. Their Data Privacy Officers' law firm accused the researcher of creating \"additional complexities\" by involving authorities and \"threatening\" public disclosure. They demanded the researcher sign a declaration (an NDA) to keep the entire matter \"strictly confidential\" under threat of legal action, citing Maltese criminal law.\n\nThe researcher refused the NDA, agreeing only to delete retained data, emphasizing the importance of transparency in coordinated disclosure and the NCVDP requirement to involve CSIRT Malta. The organization reiterated its legal threats, citing Article 337E of the Maltese Criminal Code and warning against any public mention. They also controversially blamed users for not changing their default passwords, despite GDPR stipulating controller responsibility for data security.\n\nWhile the vulnerability is now fixed, the researcher has not received confirmation that affected users, particularly parents of minors, were notified, a potential GDPR Article 34 violation. The article highlights a common \"chilling effect\" where organizations prioritize reputation management over transparent user protection, arguing legal threats themselves cause reputation damage. It concludes with recommendations for both organizations (publish CVD policies, thank researchers, don't blame users) and researchers (involve CSIRT, document everything, know your rights).",
