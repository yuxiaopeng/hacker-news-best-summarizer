    "summary": "A long-time Apple user and developer, Paris, has had their Apple ID permanently locked, effectively bricking over $30,000 worth of devices and losing access to decades of data, purchased software, and their professional digital identity. The issue began after attempting to redeem a $500 Apple Gift Card, purchased from a major brick-and-mortar retailer, which failed and was suspected to be compromised. Apple subsequently disabled their account, citing a violation of \"Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions.\"\n\nDespite claims that only media services are affected, Paris can no longer use iMessage, sign out of iCloud, or access critical Apple services for support due to authentication errors. Terabytes of family photos and message history are inaccessible, with no practical way to recover them.\n\nApple Support has been unhelpful and dismissive, refusing to provide specific reasons for the ban or escalate the case. They even suggested creating a new Apple ID, a solution Paris deems technically disastrous and potentially leading to further bans, especially given their professional role as an Apple Developer and author of technical books on Apple programming.\n\nParis, who has been a loyal customer for nearly 30 years and a prominent figure in the Apple developer community, believes an automated fraud flag triggered a \"nuclear response.\" They are pleading for a human review of their case to restore their digital life, emphasizing their desperate situation and the significant personal and professional damage caused.",

    "chinese_summary": "资深苹果用户兼开发者巴黎（Paris）的Apple ID被永久锁定，导致价值超过3万美元的设备形同“砖块”，并失去对数十年数据、已购软件和其专业数字身份的访问权限。此事源于他试图兑换一张购自大型实体零售商的500美元苹果礼品卡，但兑换失败，并被怀疑可能已被盗用。苹果随后以违反“Apple媒体服务条款和条件”为由禁用了其账户。\n\n尽管苹果声称受影响的仅是媒体服务，但巴黎（Paris）因认证错误，已无法使用iMessage、退出iCloud或访问关键的苹果支持服务。数TB的家庭照片和信息历史记录均无法访问，且目前没有实际方法可以恢复。\n\n苹果支持部门态度冷漠，毫无帮助，拒绝提供禁用的具体原因或升级处理该案件。他们甚至建议创建一个新的Apple ID，但巴黎（Paris）认为这是一个技术上灾难性的解决方案，并可能导致进一步的封禁，尤其考虑到他作为苹果开发者以及苹果编程技术书籍作者的专业身份。\n\n作为近30年的忠实用户和苹果开发者社区的知名人物，巴黎（Paris）认为一次自动化的欺诈标记触发了“核打击式”的回应。他正在恳求人工审查他的案件，以恢复他的数字生活，强调了他绝望的处境以及由此造成的巨大个人和职业损失。"

    "url": "https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/the-ars-technica-guide-to-dumb-tvs/",
    "summary": "Frustrated with smart TVs' privacy issues, ads, and complexity, this article offers alternatives to find simpler viewing experiences. The top recommendation is to take a smart TV offline and connect an Apple TV box. This setup replaces the TV's intrusive operating system with Apple's cleaner, ad-free tvOS, ensuring better privacy, reliability, and ease of use, while still allowing access to advanced display technologies. Users can block the TV's internet access via their router or utilize \"basic TV\" mode on Google TVs.\n\nFor those seeking genuinely \"dumb\" displays, brands like Emerson, Westinghouse, and Sceptre offer non-smart models, though these typically involve compromises in image and sound quality, lacking premium features. Amazon searches can also help uncover such options.\n\nAlternative display solutions include projectors, which offer large screen sizes but require dim environments, and computer monitors, which provide detailed specs and high refresh rates, especially for smaller screens, but lack TV tuners and often built-in speakers. Digital signage displays are durable but tend to be more expensive and less optimized for home entertainment.\n\nTo power these dumb displays, users can connect devices like laptops or phones. Laptops offer extensive customization, broad streaming service access (though 4K/HDR streaming can have specific browser/GPU requirements), and multi-view capabilities. Comfortable control from a couch may necessitate a Bluetooth mouse/keyboard or air mouse. Phones can connect via adapters, but often face resolution limitations (e.g., 1080p for Netflix on iPhone) and screen mirroring inconsistencies with some services.\n\nCrucially, any setup aiming for 4K or HDR content playback must ensure HDCP 2.2 compliance for both the display and the connected device.",
    "chinese_title": "厌倦智能电视？你的最佳选择。",
    "chinese_summary": "对智能电视的隐私问题、广告和复杂性感到沮丧？本文提供了一些替代方案，以获得更简单的观看体验。首要建议是将智能电视离线，并连接一个Apple TV机顶盒。这种设置用苹果更简洁、无广告的tvOS取代了电视内置的侵入性操作系统，确保了更好的隐私、可靠性和易用性，同时仍可访问先进的显示技术。用户可以通过路由器阻止电视的互联网访问，或者在Google TV上使用“基本电视”模式。\n\n对于那些寻求真正“非智能”显示器的人来说，像Emerson、Westinghouse和Sceptre这样的品牌提供非智能型号，不过这些通常在图像和音质方面有所妥协，缺乏高端功能。在亚马逊上搜索也可以帮助找到这些选项。\n\n替代的显示解决方案包括投影仪，它们提供大屏幕尺寸，但需要昏暗的环境；以及电脑显示器，它们提供详细的规格和高刷新率，尤其适用于小屏幕，但缺乏电视调谐器和通常没有内置扬声器。数字标牌显示器经久耐用，但往往更昂贵，且不适合家庭娱乐优化。\n\n为了驱动这些非智能显示器，用户可以连接笔记本电脑或手机等设备。笔记本电脑提供广泛的自定义选项、广泛的流媒体服务访问（尽管4K/HDR流媒体可能对浏览器/GPU有特定要求）以及多视图功能。从沙发上舒适地控制可能需要蓝牙鼠标/键盘或空中鼠标。手机可以通过适配器连接，但通常面临分辨率限制（例如，iPhone上的Netflix仅支持1080p），并且与某些服务的屏幕镜像存在不一致性。\n\n至关重要的是，任何旨在播放4K或HDR内容的设置，都必须确保显示器和连接设备都符合HDCP 2.2标准。"

    "summary": "On December 12th, 2025, the article announces that OpenAI is quietly integrating \"skills\" into ChatGPT's Code Interpreter and the Codex CLI tool, mirroring Anthropic's earlier implementation. Skills are straightforward: a folder with a Markdown file and optional resources, designed for easy adoption by LLMs capable of filesystem navigation.\n\nIn ChatGPT, skills reside in a new `/home/oai/skills` folder, supporting spreadsheets, DOCX, and PDFs. For documents and PDFs, OpenAI's approach involves converting pages to PNGs, then processing them with vision-enabled GPT models to retain layout and graphic details. An example shows GPT-5.2 meticulously creating a PDF summary, including self-correction for font compatibility.\n\nSeparately, OpenAI's open-source Codex CLI recently added experimental support for skills. Any folder in `~/.codex/skills` functions as a skill, activated via the `--enable skills` option. The author successfully used Codex CLI to generate a Datasette plugin, demonstrating its practical application.\n\nThe author emphasizes that OpenAI's swift adoption validates his earlier assessment of skills as a highly significant development, advocating for their formal documentation, possibly by the Agentic AI Foundation.",

    "summary": "The project details the \"necromancy\" of a friend's Nokia N900, which had a dead battery and wouldn't boot. Eschewing unreliable replacement batteries, the author initially created a prototype \"fake battery\" using supercapacitors and resistors, successfully booting the device.\n\nThis evolved into a custom 3D-printed housing for ten smaller supercapacitors (0.5F total) that fit the battery compartment. During testing, power fluctuations corrupted the internal OS, prompting a switch to booting from an SD card.\n\nAn attempt to consolidate power through the N900's original micro-USB port backfired dramatically. The port's known fragility, combined with accidental damage, led to the destruction of a critical +5V pad on the motherboard, rendering the original USB port useless.\n\nUndeterred, the author performed \"radical replacements.\" A small USB-C port was physically modified to fit the N900's chassis. Due to space constraints, only 5V and ground were wired, limiting it to 0.5A charging from basic USB-A-to-USB-C cables. A new 3D-printed \"battery\" was then designed to house a large capacitor, a diode, and the salvaged original battery's control module, drawing power from the new USB-C port.\n\nThis bespoke solution successfully resurrected the N900, allowing it to boot from the SD card and find a new purpose as an online radio device.",

By October 20, all but one of his blog posts were de-indexed, showing the status \"Crawled – currently not indexed,\" and the last post was de-indexed by November 3.\n\nZhan undertook extensive troubleshooting. He ruled out domain issues by successfully indexing another Bear Blog on a different subdomain (www.james-zhan.com). Content quality or quantity was also eliminated as other minimalist Bear blogs indexed fine. Similarly, the URL structure was not the cause, confirmed by other Bear blogs using the same default setup. Bear Blog's founder, Herman, also confirmed no technical issues with the blog or its CSS code that would prevent indexing. Crucially, the blog remained properly indexed by other search engines like DuckDuckGo, Bing, and Brave, indicating no inherent technical flaw on the site's part.\n\nUnable to resolve the mysterious de-indexing, Zhan migrated his blog to a new subdomain, journal.james-zhan.com (the current site), moved domain forwarding to Porkbun, and set up redirects. For the new blog, he decided against manually submitting sitemaps to GSC, hoping for natural indexing. Zhan now seeks public input to understand what caused the original de-indexing.",
