    "summary": "Nathan Edwards, a senior reviews editor, recounts his initial week using Linux as his main desktop OS after growing frustrated with Windows. His goal was to determine if Linux could be a \"wingable alternative\" without requiring extensive technical \"futzing.\"\n\nHe chose CachyOS, an Arch-based distro known for modern hardware optimization and gaming ease. The installation process involved selecting a bootloader (Limine), partitioning his drive (initially 100GB root, later expanded), and picking a desktop environment (KDE). His most immediate and humorous challenge was his ancient gaming mouse, which would move the cursor but not register clicks on the desktop, yet worked perfectly fine within games.\n\nDespite this, much of his hardware, including GPU drivers, monitor, speakers, webcam, and printer, \"just worked\" with no effort. Installing popular applications like Chromium, Discord, Slack, and Audacity was straightforward using various Linux app repositories. Gaming also proved simple: CachyOS's one-click gaming package allowed \"The Outer Worlds\" to run flawlessly via Proton, complete with cloud save syncing.\n\nMinor issues include the lack of his preferred Arc browser and official apps for services like Airtable and Spotify (though browser versions work). The main frustration is getting Minecraft: Bedrock Edition to run, crucial for playing with his children.\n\nEdwards acknowledges it's a \"honeymoon phase\" but reports \"Regret level: none.\" He finds the transition \"much easier than expected\" and appreciates the \"quieter experience\" compared to Windows' nuisances. Though his job prevents exclusive Linux use, his first week suggests a positive outlook for his Linux journey.",

    "url": "https://mitchellh.com/writing/ghostty-memory-leak-fix",
    "summary": "Ghostty users reported an absurd memory leak, with one instance reaching 37 GB after 10 days. The fix has been found and merged, available in upcoming releases.\n\nThe leak stemmed from how Ghostty manages terminal memory using a `PageList` – a doubly-linked list of memory pages. Most pages are standard-sized, pulled from a memory pool. However, for content like many emojis or hyperlinks, larger \"non-standard\" pages are allocated directly via `mmap`. Standard pages are returned to the pool when freed, while non-standard ones require `munmap`.\n\nGhostty also optimizes scrollback pruning by reusing the oldest page as the newest when the scrollback limit is reached, avoiding reallocations.\n\nThe bug occurred when a non-standard page was reused via this scrollback optimization. Its *metadata* was reset to indicate a standard size, but the underlying large `mmap`'d memory allocation was never actually resized. Later, when the system attempted to free this page, it saw the \"standard size\" metadata, assumed it was a pooled page, and consequently *never* called `munmap`. This led to the large `mmap`'d memory being leaked.\n\nInitially, non-standard pages were rare, so the leak went unnoticed since Ghostty 1.0. However, the recent rise of CLI applications like Claude Code, which frequently produce complex multi-codepoint graphemes, started generating numerous non-standard pages under heavy scrollback, thus triggering the leak at scale.\n\nThe fix is conceptually simple: non-standard pages are no longer reused during scrollback pruning. Instead, they are properly `munmap`'d, and a fresh standard-sized page is allocated from the pool.\n\nTo aid diagnosis, virtual memory tags were implemented on macOS, allowing Ghostty's `PageList` memory to be specifically identified in debugging tools, confirming the leak and verifying the fix. Existing leak prevention measures had missed this specific bug due to its unique trigger conditions; a new test now prevents regression.",
    "chinese_title": "发现并修复Ghostty最大的内存泄漏",
    "chinese_summary": "Ghostty用户报告了一个离谱的内存泄漏，某个实例在10天内达到了37 GB。修复方案已经找到并合并，将在未来的版本中提供。\n\n该泄漏源于Ghostty使用`PageList`（一个内存页的双向链表）管理终端内存的方式。大多数页面是标准大小的，从内存池中获取。然而，对于包含大量表情符号或超链接等内容，更大的“非标准”页面则通过`mmap`直接分配。标准页面在释放时会返回内存池，而非标准页面则需要`munmap`。\n\nGhostty还通过在达到回滚限制时将最旧的页面重用为最新页面来优化回滚历史的修剪，从而避免了重新分配。\n\n当一个非标准页面通过这种回滚优化被重用时，bug就出现了。它的*元数据*被重置以指示其为标准大小，但底层的、通过`mmap`分配的大块内存实际上从未被重新调整大小。后来，当系统尝试释放此页面时，它看到了“标准大小”的元数据，认为这是一个池化页面，因此*从未*调用`munmap`。这导致了通过`mmap`分配的大块内存泄漏。\n\n最初，非标准页面很少见，因此自Ghostty 1.0以来，此泄漏一直未被发现。然而，最近CLI应用程序（如Claude Code）的兴起，它们经常生成复杂的多码点字素，在大量回滚操作下开始生成大量的非标准页面，从而大规模触发了泄漏。\n\n修复方案在概念上很简单：在回滚修剪期间不再重用非标准页面。相反，它们会被正确地`munmap`，并从内存池中分配一个新的标准大小页面。\n\n为了帮助诊断，macOS上实现了虚拟内存标签，使得Ghostty的`PageList`内存可以在调试工具中被专门识别，从而确认了泄漏并验证了修复。现有的泄漏预防措施由于其独特的触发条件而未能发现这个特定的bug；一个新的测试现在可以防止此问题再次出现。"

Sprites are durable, instantly creatable (1-2 seconds) Linux micro-VMs, offering a root shell with 100GB storage. They retain state and installed software across sessions, even after prolonged inactivity, and feature fast, casual checkpoint/restore functionality (approx. 1 second), akin to Git for an entire system.\n\nSprites are designed to be cheap, stopping metering when idle, and integrate with Fly.io's Anycast network for HTTPS access, enabling users to manage hundreds easily. Mackey contends that AI agents (\"Claude\") require actual \"computers\" with durable storage and persistence, not stateless containers. Current sandboxes force agents into inefficient workarounds, such as repeatedly rebuilding environments, relying on external state storage, or encoding state into \"plan files,\" which limits their capabilities to short-lived tasks.\n\nThe author envisions a future where individuals leverage agents on durable machines like Sprites to build and own applications that solve specific problems, blurring the lines between development and production (\"dev is prod, prod is dev\"). He believes sandboxes are holding back this evolution, and that the \"disposable cloud computer\" paradigm offered by Sprites marks the end of the ephemeral sandbox era.",
