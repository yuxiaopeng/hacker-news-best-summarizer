    "title": "The Singularity will occur on a Tuesday",
    "url": "https://campedersen.com/singularity",
    "summary": "The article posits that the \"singularity\" is less about machines achieving superintelligence and more a \"social singularity\" driven by human reaction to AI. The author analyzed five AI progress metrics: MMLU scores, tokens per dollar, frontier release intervals, arXiv \"emergent\" papers, and Copilot code share. Using a hyperbolic model designed to predict an infinite value at a finite time (t_s), the goal was to find a shared singularity date where the R² of the hyperbolic fit peaked for individual metrics.\n\nCrucially, only one metric—the count of arXiv \"emergent\" papers (representing field excitement about AI behaviors)—displayed genuine hyperbolic curvature and a clear R² peak. The other four metrics, related to machine capability and cost, were better fit by linear models, showing no individual signal for a finite-time singularity.\n\nThis leads to the conclusion that while machines are improving steadily, humans are accelerating their \"freaking out.\" The calculated singularity date (precise to the millisecond and around 2034) is derived solely from the accelerating rate at which humans are identifying and discussing emergent AI behaviors.\n\nThis \"social singularity\" is already causing significant disruption: anticipatory labor market layoffs, lagging institutional and regulatory responses, concentrated capital, widespread psychological distress (FOBO), an epistemic crisis in AI research, and political realignments. The author argues that t_s marks when humans lose the capacity for coherent collective decision-making about AI, rather than a point of machine superintelligence, emphasizing that the social fabric is fraying well before any technical \"pole.\" Minor data corrections were noted but did not alter the date, as the influential metric remained unchanged.",
    "chinese_title": "奇点将在星期二发生",
    "chinese_summary": "文章提出，“奇点”与其说是机器实现超智能，不如说是由人类对AI的反应驱动的“社会奇点”。作者分析了五个AI进展指标：MMLU分数、每美元代币数、前沿发布间隔、arXiv“涌现”论文以及Copilot代码分享率。利用旨在预测在有限时间（t_s）达到无限值的双曲线模型，目标是找到一个共同的奇点日期，在该日期，双曲线拟合的R²值在各个指标中达到峰值。\n\n至关重要的是，只有一个指标——arXiv“涌现”论文的数量（代表着领域对AI行为的兴奋度）——显示出真正的双曲线曲率和一个清晰的R²峰值。其他四个与机器能力和成本相关的指标更适合线性模型，没有显示出有限时间奇点的单独信号。\n\n这得出了一个结论：虽然机器在稳步改进，但人类的“恐慌”速度正在加快。计算出的奇点日期（精确到毫秒，大约在2034年）完全来源于人类识别和讨论AI涌现行为的速度日益加快。\n\n这个“社会奇点”已经导致了重大的混乱：前瞻性劳动力市场裁员、滞后的制度和监管响应、资本集中、广泛的心理困扰（FOBO）、AI研究中的认知危机以及政治重组。作者认为，t_s标志着人类失去了对AI进行连贯集体决策的能力，而不是机器达到超智能的时间点，并强调社会结构在任何技术“极点”到来之前就已经开始瓦解。文中提到了轻微的数据修正，但由于具有影响力的指标保持不变，这些修正并未改变最终日期。"

    "url": "https://europeanbusinessmagazine.com/business/europes-24-trillion-breakup-with-visa-and-mastercard-has-begun/",
    "summary": "ECB President Christine Lagarde has urged Europe to establish its own digital payment system, warning that its current reliance on American infrastructure like Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, and Alipay sends European consumer data to the US or China. This dependence, processing $24 trillion annually, creates a significant geopolitical vulnerability, as highlighted by the disruption caused when Russia was cut off from these networks in 2022.\n\nIn response, the European Payments Initiative (EPI), a consortium of 16 banks, launched Wero in July 2024. Wero is a digital wallet built on SEPA instant credit transfers, designed to enable cross-border payments using only a phone number, bypassing non-European networks. It already has over 47 million users in Belgium, France, and Germany, processing €7.5 billion.\n\nA major breakthrough occurred on February 2, when EPI signed an agreement with the EuroPA Alliance (a coalition including Italy's Bancomat and Spain's Bizum). This deal instantly connects Wero to approximately 130 million users across 13 countries, covering 72% of the EU and Norway. This move directly addresses previous failures due to fragmentation by integrating existing national payment systems.\n\nWhile significant investment and overcoming deeply entrenched consumer habits are challenges, political support for European strategic autonomy is stronger than ever. The initiative, complementing the ECB's proposed digital euro, aims to make European payment sovereignty a reality.",

    "chinese_summary": "欧洲央行行长克里斯蒂娜·拉加德（Christine Lagarde）敦促欧洲建立自己的数字支付系统，她警告称，目前对Visa、万事达卡（Mastercard）、PayPal和支付宝等支付基础设施的依赖，会导致欧洲消费者数据被发送到美国或中国。这种每年处理24万亿美元交易的依赖，造成了重大的地缘政治脆弱性，正如2022年俄罗斯被切断与这些网络的连接时所造成的混乱所凸显的那样。\n\n作为回应，由16家银行组成的欧洲支付倡议（European Payments Initiative, EPI）于2024年7月推出了Wero。Wero是一款基于SEPA即时信用转账构建的数字钱包，旨在仅通过手机号码即可实现跨境支付，从而绕过非欧洲网络。它已在比利时、法国和德国拥有超过4700万用户，处理了75亿欧元。\n\n2月2日，EPI与EuroPA联盟（一个包括意大利Bancomat和西班牙Bizum在内的联盟）签署了一项协议，这是一个重大突破。这项协议将Wero立即连接到13个国家的约1.3亿用户，覆盖了欧盟和挪威72%的区域。此举通过整合现有的国家支付系统，直接解决了此前因碎片化而导致的失败。\n\n尽管需要大量投资并克服根深蒂固的消费者习惯，但对欧洲战略自主性的政治支持比以往任何时候都更加坚定。这项倡议与欧洲央行提出的数字欧元相辅相成，旨在将欧洲支付主权变为现实。"

    "url": "https://www.jamesdrandall.com/posts/the_thing_i_loved_has_changed/",
    "summary": "The author, who began programming in 1983 at age seven, reflects on how his relationship with the craft has profoundly changed over 42 years. He fondly remembers the early era (8-bit to 486DX2-66) where direct interaction with hardware, visible constraints, and the necessity to deeply understand machines (e.g., CONFIG.SYS, IRQ conflicts) fostered immense creativity and satisfaction. This \"Wild West\" of computing, marked by optimism, eventually professionalized, with abstraction layers like Windows turning computers into appliances, and platforms shifting from empowering creation to monetization and surveillance, a change the author finds distasteful.\n\nHe notes that while he adapted to countless technological shifts over four decades, always applying core systems understanding to new tools, AI presents a different challenge. It's not just a new platform, but a fundamental shift that \"hollows out\" the satisfying, puzzle-solving aspects of development. The intimacy of figuring out elegant solutions is compressed into a prompt and response. He humorously points out that modern developers already operate far up abstraction chains, but he, having once understood the entire machine, feels the loss of that direct connection more acutely.\n\nWhile acknowledging that his experience, judgment, and architectural thinking remain highly valuable in guiding AI tools, the *feeling* of wonder and discovery has diminished. Now 50, he describes this as a \"fallow period\"—a time of re-evaluating his identity as a builder. He's still creating faster than ever, but the \"magic\" is different, and he's learning to navigate this new landscape, even without a neat conclusion.",
    "chinese_title": "我七岁开始编程。我现在五十岁了，我所热爱的事物也变了。",
    "chinese_summary": "作者，1983年七岁时开始编程，回顾了42年来他与这门手艺的关系发生了怎样的深刻变化。他深情地回忆起早期时代（从8位机到486DX2-66），那时与硬件的直接交互、明显的限制以及深入理解机器（例如CONFIG.SYS、IRQ冲突）的必要性，极大地激发了创造力和满足感。这个充满乐观的计算“蛮荒西部”，最终走向专业化，Windows等抽象层将电脑变成了家用电器，平台也从赋能创造转向了变现和监控，作者对此转变感到厌恶。\n\n他指出，尽管四十年来他适应了无数次技术变革，总是将核心系统理解应用于新工具，但人工智能带来了不同的挑战。它不仅仅是一个新平台，而是一种根本性的转变，\"掏空\"了开发中那些令人满足的、解决谜题的乐趣。琢磨出优雅解决方案的那份亲密感被压缩成了一个提示和响应。他幽默地指出，现代开发者已经在高度抽象的链条上操作，但他，作为一个曾理解整台机器的人，更敏锐地感受到了那种直接联系的丧失。\n\n尽管他承认自己的经验、判断和架构思维在指导人工智能工具方面仍然极具价值，但那种惊奇和发现的*感觉*却减弱了。如今50岁的他，将此描述为一个“休耕期”——一个重新评估自己作为“建造者”身份的时期。他仍然比以往任何时候都创造得更快，但“魔力”已然不同，他正在学习驾驭这个新格局，即便目前还没有一个清晰的结论。"

    "url": "https://theintercept.com/2026/02/10/google-ice-subpoena-student-journalist/",
    "summary": "Google complied with an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) subpoena demanding extensive personal data, including credit card and bank account numbers, of student activist and journalist Amandla Thomas-Johnson. Thomas-Johnson was targeted after attending a pro-Palestinian protest at Cornell University and later going into hiding due to executive orders against student protesters.\n\nGoogle informed Thomas-Johnson via email that it had already shared his metadata with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The full scope of the subpoena, which included usernames, addresses, IP masking services, and financial information linked to his Gmail account, was not previously known. Thomas-Johnson confirmed his bank and credit card details were attached to his account for app purchases.\n\nA key criticism is that Google provided no prior notice, denying Thomas-Johnson the chance to legally challenge the subpoena, unlike a similar case involving his friend. The subpoena lacked detailed justification, only stating it was \"in connection with an investigation or inquiry relating to the enforcement of U.S. immigration laws,\" and requested a gag order.\n\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and the ACLU of Northern California have since sent a letter to major tech companies, including Google, urging them to resist similar DHS subpoenas without court intervention, provide users with notice, and oppose gag orders to protect user privacy and speech. Legal experts highlight the importance of prior notice for users to protect their rights and emphasize the need for legal reforms to the Stored Communications Act for higher standards of government data access.\n\nThomas-Johnson, a British national, believes ICE sought to track and detain him, but he has since fled to Senegal. He remains committed to his journalism, despite the \"terrifying\" experience. Google did not respond to a request for comment.",

The company addressed the apparent contradiction of raising significant capital shortly after their Series B, especially given their public stance on the perils of over-funding and the fact that they didn't \"need\" the money due to achieving strong product-market fit and sound unit economics.\n\nThe decision was largely driven by their existing investors, who were eager to support the rapidly growing business. Oxide valued the opportunity to raise solely from these trusted partners who understood their vision and commitment.\n\nStrategically, the Series C addresses Oxide's biggest challenge: time and capital. This substantial funding entirely de-risks future capital needs, crucially ensuring the company's independence. This is paramount for customers, who frequently express concerns about promising startups being acquired by larger entities. Oxide's stated goal is to build a \"generational company,\" not to be an acquisition target. The Series C provides certainty for their long-term survival and mission, reassuring customers and empowering them to \"change computing forever.\"",
