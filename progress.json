    "title": "I miss thinking hard",
    "url": "https://www.jernesto.com/articles/thinking_hard",
    "summary": "The author yearns for \"thinking hard\"—the sustained, multi-day mental engagement required to overcome difficult problems. He identifies two core personality traits: \"The Builder,\" driven by creating pragmatic solutions quickly, and \"The Thinker,\" which craves deep, prolonged mental struggle.\n\nReflecting on his university physics days, the author was a \"Thinker,\" solving complex problems through dedicated, often multi-week contemplation, a process he considered his \"superpower\" and a source of deep satisfaction. Initially, software engineering perfectly balanced these traits, satisfying the Builder with creation and the Thinker with challenging problems.\n\nHowever, AI has disrupted this equilibrium. While \"vibe coding\" satisfies The Builder by accelerating development, it drastically reduces the need for the creative problem-solving The Thinker thrives on. The author feels professionally stunted, despite producing more complex software. He attributes this to starving The Thinker.\n\nHe recognizes the \"trap of pragmatism\": AI's \"good enough\" solutions, achieved in a fraction of the time, are difficult for his Builder side to reject, even if his manual efforts might yield superior results. This internal conflict prevents him from purely indulging The Thinker. Efforts to re-engage with \"hard thinking\" outside of coding, such as revisiting physics problems, are undermined by The Builder's insistence on utility and efficiency.\n\nThe author concludes without a solution, feeling his two halves can no longer be simultaneously satisfied within his current path, lamenting the diminishing opportunities for true creative problem-solving.",
    "chinese_title": "我想念努力思考。",
    "chinese_summary": "作者渴望“苦思冥想”——即解决难题所需的、持续数日的精神投入。他识别出两种核心人格特质：“建造者”，其动力是快速创造实用解决方案；以及“思考者”，渴望深度、持久的脑力搏斗。\n\n回顾大学物理学习时期，作者曾是一个“思考者”，通过专注的、通常长达数周的沉思来解决复杂问题，他认为这个过程是他的“超能力”和深刻满足感的来源。最初，软件工程完美平衡了这些特质，通过创造来满足“建造者”，通过有挑战性的问题来满足“思考者”。\n\n然而，人工智能打破了这种平衡。虽然“直觉式编程”通过加速开发来满足“建造者”，但它却大大减少了“思考者”赖以生存的创造性解决问题的需求。尽管生产出更复杂的软件，作者却感觉自己的专业发展停滞不前，他将此归因于“思考者”的“饥饿”。\n\n他认识到“实用主义的陷阱”：人工智能在极短时间内实现的“足够好”的解决方案，即使他手动努力可能产生更优越的结果，他的“建造者”一面也难以拒绝。这种内在冲突使他无法纯粹地沉溺于“思考者”。尝试在编程之外重新投入“深入思考”，例如重新审视物理问题，却被“建造者”对实用性和效率的坚持所破坏。\n\n作者在没有找到解决方案的情况下结束，感觉在他的当前道路上，他内心的两个自我无法再同时得到满足，并哀叹真正创造性解决问题的机会日益减少。"

    "url": "https://apnews.com/article/europe-digital-sovereignty-big-tech-9f5388b68a0648514cebc8d92f682060",
    "summary": "European governments and institutions are increasingly abandoning U.S. Big Tech digital services like Zoom, Teams, and Microsoft Office in favor of homegrown or open-source alternatives, driven by a strong push for \"digital sovereignty.\"\n\nFrance exemplifies this trend, with 2.5 million civil servants set to switch from U.S. video conferencing tools to a domestic service, Visio, by 2027 to ensure security and confidentiality. Other examples include Austria's military adopting LibreOffice, the German state of Schleswig-Holstein migrating 44,000 employee inboxes to open-source email, and cities like Lyon and Copenhagen exploring free office software.\n\nThis pivot is primarily fueled by geopolitical concerns, intensified by fears that U.S. tech companies could be compelled by their government to cut off access, as highlighted by past U.S. sanctions impacting Microsoft's service to the International Criminal Court. Concerns about data privacy, the vulnerability of data in U.S.-hosted cloud services, and a desire to curb the dominance of U.S. tech giants also play significant roles. European officials, including EU Commissioner Henna Virkkunen, warn that tech reliance \"can be weaponized.\"\n\nWhile some U.S. providers offer \"sovereign cloud\" solutions in Europe, the broader movement emphasizes achieving independence from single vendors, moving beyond mere cost savings to prioritizing digital freedom and avoiding proprietary lock-in.",
    "chinese_title": "法国弃用Zoom和Teams，随着欧洲寻求摆脱美国的数字主权。",
    "chinese_summary": "欧洲各国政府和机构正在日益放弃Zoom、Teams和Microsoft Office等美国大型科技公司的数字服务，转而青睐本土或开源替代方案，这主要受“数字主权”的强烈推动。\n\n法国是这一趋势的典型代表，250万公务员计划到2027年从美国视频会议工具转向国内服务Visio，以确保安全性和保密性。其他例子包括奥地利军队采用LibreOffice、德国石勒苏益格-荷尔斯泰因州将4.4万名员工的邮箱迁移到开源电子邮件，以及里昂和哥本哈根等城市正在探索免费办公软件。\n\n这一转向主要源于地缘政治担忧，这种担忧因美国科技公司可能被迫切断服务的恐惧而加剧，正如美国过去对国际刑事法院微软服务施加制裁所凸显的那样。对数据隐私的担忧、美国托管云服务中数据的脆弱性以及遏制美国科技巨头主导地位的愿望也发挥了重要作用。包括欧盟委员Henna Virkkunen在内的欧洲官员警告称，对技术的依赖“可能被武器化”。\n\n尽管一些美国供应商在欧洲提供“主权云”解决方案，但这一更广泛的趋势强调的是实现对单一供应商的独立，超越单纯的成本节约，优先考虑数字自由并避免专有锁定。"

    "title": "Data centers in space makes no sense",
    "url": "https://civai.org/blog/space-data-centers",
    "summary": "In the article \"Data centers in space makes no sense,\" the author, Andrew L. C. Chen, argues against the practicality and benefits of placing data centers in orbit. He contends that while some proponents suggest advantages like free cooling, cheaper land, and renewable energy, these are significantly outweighed by numerous logistical and physical challenges.\n\nChen highlights that the cost and complexity of launching and maintaining equipment in space are astronomical compared to terrestrial solutions. The article emphasizes that components must be ruggedized for extreme radiation and vacuum, adding to their expense and reducing performance. Furthermore, latency for Earth-bound users would increase due to the speed of light limits, making real-time applications impractical. The idea of \"free cooling\" is debunked, as dissipating heat in a vacuum requires complex, heavy radiators.\n\nUltimately, the author asserts that terrestrial data centers, with ongoing innovations in cooling, renewable energy, and efficient land use, remain far superior. The proposed benefits of space data centers are either non-existent or come with prohibitive costs and technical hurdles that make them an irrational investment compared to improving ground-based infrastructure.",
    "chinese_title": "太空数据中心毫无意义",
    "chinese_summary": "在题为《太空数据中心毫无意义》的文章中，作者Andrew L. C. Chen对将数据中心置于轨道上的可行性和益处提出了反驳。他认为，尽管一些支持者提出了诸如免费冷却、更便宜的土地和可再生能源等优势，但这些优势与众多的物流和物理挑战相比，则显得微不足道。\n\nChen强调，与地面解决方案相比，在太空中发射和维护设备的成本和复杂性是天文数字。文章强调，组件必须针对极端辐射和真空环境进行加固，这增加了它们的成本并降低了性能。此外，由于光速限制，对地面用户而言，延迟将增加，使实时应用变得不切实际。“免费冷却”的说法被驳斥，因为在真空中散热需要复杂而笨重的散热器。\n\n最终，作者断言，地面数据中心凭借在冷却、可再生能源和土地高效利用方面的持续创新，仍然具有无可比拟的优势。太空数据中心所提出的优势要么根本不存在，要么伴随着高昂的成本和技术障碍，与改进地面基础设施相比，这使得它们成为一项不理性的投资。"

    "url": "https://lars.ingebrigtsen.no/2026/02/02/whats-up-with-all-those-equals-signs-anyway/",
    "summary": "The article explains why `equals signs` appear in old emails shared on Twitter, clarifying they are not code or OCR errors, but artifacts of \"quoted printable\" encoding mishandled by incompetent conversion processes.\n\nThere are two main reasons for their appearance:\n\n1.  **Line Wrapping:** Old email systems (pre-90s) used \"quoted printable\" to handle long lines. An equals sign (`=`) followed by a carriage return and line feed (CRLF) signals a \"soft\" line break, meaning the line should logically be continuous. Proper decoding removes `=CRLF`. The visible equals signs result from flawed conversions: if emails were converted from CRLF (Windows/SMTP standard) to NL (Unix) line endings, a decoding algorithm expecting `=CRLF` would fail to remove the `=` when only `=NL` was present, leaving it visible or even causing incorrect character deletion. The author suggests the conversion likely reused an algorithm expecting CRLF in an SMTP server context, failing on Unix-style files.\n\n2.  **Character Encoding:** Equals signs also encode \"funny characters\" (non-ASCII) as `=XX` (where XX are hexadecimal digits). For instance, `=C2=A0` represents a non-breaking space, often used for indentation. The article speculates that converters might have performed simple search-and-replaces for these sequences instead of using a proper decoder, leaving parts like `=C2` visible.\n\nIn essence, the equals signs are a blend of technical legacy (quoted-printable encoding for line breaks and non-ASCII characters) and buggy decoding by those who processed the old emails.",
    "chinese_title": "那些等号究竟是怎么回事？",
    "chinese_summary": "这篇文章解释了为什么等号会出现在推特上分享的老旧电子邮件中，澄清它们并非代码或OCR错误，而是“quoted printable”编码在不专业的转换过程中被错误处理后留下的产物。\n\n它们出现的主要原因有两个：\n\n1.  **换行：** 老旧电子邮件系统（90年代以前）使用“quoted printable”来处理长行。一个等号（=）后跟一个回车符和换行符（CRLF）表示一个“软”换行，意味着该行在逻辑上应该连续。正确的解码会移除`=CRLF`。可见的等号是由于有缺陷的转换造成的：如果电子邮件从CRLF（Windows/SMTP标准）转换为NL（Unix）行尾，一个期望`=CRLF`的解码算法在只有`=NL`存在时，将无法移除`=`，使其可见，甚至导致错误的字符删除。作者认为，这种转换很可能是在SMTP服务器环境中重复使用了期望CRLF的算法，但在Unix风格的文件上失败了。\n\n2.  **字符编码：** 等号也用于将“奇怪字符”（非ASCII字符）编码为`=XX`（其中XX是十六进制数字）。例如，`=C2=A0`表示一个不间断空格，常用于缩进。文章推测，转换器可能对这些序列进行了简单的查找和替换，而不是使用适当的解码器，从而导致`=C2`这样的部分可见。\n\n本质上，这些等号是技术遗产（用于换行符和非ASCII字符的quoted-printable编码）与处理这些老旧电子邮件的人所进行的有缺陷的解码共同作用的产物。"

    "summary": "The article from Frommer's reports that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has introduced a new $45 fee for travelers unable to present an acceptable ID at the airport, who must instead undergo an \"enhanced screening\" process. However, regulatory expert Charles Leocha vehemently argues that this fee is illegal.\n\nLeocha's primary contention is that the TSA, as a federal agency, lacks the congressional authority to impose new fees or taxes on the public. He explains that while agencies can charge for voluntary, value-added services (like TSA PreCheck), this $45 charge is for a mandatory security screening—a core function of the TSA already funded by existing taxes. Creating such a fee, he asserts, fundamentally alters the agency's funding mechanism without legislative approval from Congress.\n\nAdditionally, Leocha suggests the fee is discriminatory, potentially disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations such as the homeless, elderly, or those who have lost their identification and face difficulties in obtaining replacements. The article concludes that this new fee represents an overreach of the TSA's power, improperly shifting the cost of a basic security function onto specific travelers without a legal basis.",
