    "url": "https://theconversation.com/openai-has-deleted-the-word-safely-from-its-mission-and-its-new-structure-is-a-test-for-whether-ai-serves-society-or-shareholders-274467",
    "summary": "OpenAI has controversially removed the word \"safely\" from its mission statement, signaling a significant shift in its priorities from safety to profit. Its 2023 mission aimed \"to build artificial intelligence that safely benefits humanity, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return.\" However, its 2024 IRS filing shows the mission updated to \"to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity,\" omitting both \"safely\" and the financial independence clause.\n\nThis change coincided with OpenAI's transformation from a nonprofit into a business increasingly focused on profits, driven by the immense capital required for AI development. In October 2025, it formally restructured into a nonprofit OpenAI Foundation and a for-profit OpenAI Group. The Foundation now owns only 26% of the Group, effectively ceding majority control, while major investors like Microsoft hold significant stakes. This move attracted billions in new investments, increasing OpenAI's valuation to over $500 billion.\n\nThe author, a scholar of nonprofit accountability, views this as a critical, underreported shift, especially given pending lawsuits against OpenAI alleging psychological manipulation and wrongful death. While the new structure includes some safety committees, the removal of \"safely\" from the core mission makes accountability challenging. The author criticizes OpenAI's board and the Attorneys General of California and Delaware for allowing this, suggesting alternative models where nonprofits retained greater control over their for-profit counterparts would better serve the public interest.",
    "chinese_title": "OpenAI 从其使命中删除了“安全地”一词。",
    "chinese_summary": "OpenAI争议性地从其使命宣言中删除了“安全地”一词，这预示着其优先事项已从安全转向利润，发生了重大转变。其2023年的使命旨在“构建能够安全地造福人类的人工智能，不受制于创造经济回报的需求”。然而，其2024年提交给美国国税局的文件显示，使命已更新为“确保通用人工智能造福全人类”，删去了“安全地”以及财务独立条款。\n\n这一变化恰逢OpenAI从一个非营利组织转型为一个日益关注利润的商业实体，这主要是由人工智能开发所需巨额资本所驱动的。2025年10月，它正式重组为非营利性的OpenAI基金会和营利性的OpenAI集团。基金会目前仅持有集团26%的股份，实际上已放弃了多数控制权，而微软等主要投资者则持有大量股份。此举吸引了数十亿美元的新投资，使OpenAI的估值超过5000亿美元。\n\n作者是一位非营利组织问责制学者，他认为这是一个关键但未被充分报道的转变，尤其考虑到针对OpenAI的诉讼悬而未决，这些诉讼指控其涉及心理操控和不当致死。尽管新结构包含一些安全委员会，但从核心使命中移除“安全地”一词，使得问责变得困难。作者批评OpenAI董事会以及加利福尼亚州和特拉华州的检察长允许这种情况发生，并建议采用其他模式，即非营利组织对其营利性对应实体保留更大的控制权，这将更好地服务于公共利益。"

    "url": "https://aimilios.bearblog.dev/reverse-engineering-sleep-mask/",
    "summary": "The author reverse-engineered a smart sleep mask from Kickstarter after its official app proved buggy. Using Claude (Opus 4.6), they initially attempted Bluetooth protocol mapping, but it was non-standard. Claude then decompiled the Android Flutter app's APK, analyzing strings in the compiled Dart binary. This revealed critical information: hardcoded credentials for the company's MQTT message broker, cloud API endpoints, command function names, and the packet structure. Further analysis with `blutter` allowed Claude to fully map all fifteen device commands, enabling control over features like vibration, heating, and electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) via a custom web dashboard.\n\nThe alarming discovery came when Claude used the hardcoded MQTT credentials to connect to the company's message broker. The broker was open and actively broadcasting live EEG brainwave data from approximately 25 active sleep masks, as well as data from other IoT devices like air quality monitors. This meant the author could read real-time brainwave activity from strangers globally. Crucially, because all devices share the same credentials and broker, an attacker could not only monitor brainwaves but also send electrical impulses (EMS) to other users in their sleep. The author has disclosed the issue to the unnamed company and highlighted the importance of \"Digital Hygiene.\" Claude completed the entire reverse engineering process autonomously in 30 minutes.",

    "chinese_summary": "作者在官方应用出现问题后，对一款购自 Kickstarter 的智能睡眠眼罩进行了逆向工程。使用 Claude (Opus 4.6)，他们最初尝试进行蓝牙协议映射，但发现该协议并非标准。Claude 随后反编译了这款安卓 Flutter 应用的 APK，并分析了编译后的 Dart 二进制文件中的字符串。这揭示了关键信息：该公司 MQTT 消息代理的硬编码凭据、云 API 端点、命令函数名称以及数据包结构。借助 `blutter` 进一步分析，Claude 能够完全映射所有十五个设备命令，从而可以通过一个自定义的网页仪表板控制振动、加热和电肌肉刺激 (EMS) 等功能。\n\n当 Claude 使用硬编码的 MQTT 凭据连接到该公司的消息代理时，一个令人震惊的发现浮出水面。该代理是开放的，并正在积极广播来自大约 25 个活跃睡眠眼罩的实时脑电波 (EEG) 数据，以及来自空气质量监测器等其他物联网设备的数据。这意味着作者可以读取来自全球陌生人的实时脑电波活动。至关重要的是，由于所有设备共享相同的凭据和代理，攻击者不仅可以监测脑电波，还可以向其他正在熟睡的用户发送电脉冲 (EMS)。作者已向这家未具名公司披露了该问题，并强调了“数字卫生”的重要性。Claude 仅用 30 分钟就自主完成了整个逆向工程过程。"
