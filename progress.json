    "summary": "The Stack Exchange Data Explorer query titled \"Total monthly number of StackOverflow questions over time\" visualizes the volume of questions posted on Stack Overflow each month from its launch in August 2008 through early 2024.\n\nThe data reveals a clear historical trend. Stack Overflow experienced rapid and substantial growth from its inception, with the number of monthly questions climbing steeply over its initial years. Question volume peaked between approximately 2013 and 2018, consistently exceeding 500,000 questions per month during this period of high engagement.\n\nHowever, a distinct and steady decline in monthly questions began around 2018. This downward trend has continued, leading to significantly lower question volumes in recent years. As of early 2024, the monthly number of questions fluctuates around 150,000 to 200,000, representing a substantial decrease of over 50% from its peak activity. The graph illustrates a journey from explosive initial growth to a sustained high, followed by a significant contraction in the volume of new questions being posted on the platform.",

    "title": "Daft Punk Easter Egg in the BPM Tempo of Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger?",
    "url": "https://www.madebywindmill.com/tempi/blog/hbfs-bpm/",
    "summary": "John Scalo, creator of the music tempo app Tempi, proposes that Daft Punk’s “Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger” (HBFS) contains an intentional Easter egg in its precise BPM: 123.45. While online databases typically list the BPM as 123 or 123.48, Scalo’s refined tempo detection system consistently indicated a fractional value near 123.4.\n\nTo establish the exact BPM, Scalo employed a manual method, arguing that humans can precisely determine tempo more accurately than most software. He opened HBFS in an audio application, identified \"bookend\" beats, measured the exact duration between them (216.282 seconds for a Discovery CD rip, 216.276 for a YouTube version), and counted 446 beats (445 intervals). Applying the formula `bpm = 60 * (beats - 1) / duration`, he calculated the CD rip's BPM as 123.44994... and the YouTube version's as 123.45336.... Both values round almost perfectly to 123.45.\n\nInvestigating intentionality, Scalo researched Daft Punk's production gear for the \"Discovery\" album (1999-2000). While their E-mu SP-1200 and Akai MPC-3000 sequencers supported BPMs to one decimal place, Emagic’s Logic Audio software, also utilized, supported up to four decimal places. Though it’s unknown which specific tool was used for HBFS, the CD version's remarkable proximity to exactly 123.45 leads Scalo to believe this fractional tempo was a deliberate, humorous detail, a \"well played\" hidden secret from the robot duo.",
    "chinese_title": "《Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger》的BPM节拍里藏有蠢朋克的彩蛋吗？",
    "chinese_summary": "音乐节奏应用 Tempi 的开发者约翰·斯卡洛提出，蠢朋克乐队的歌曲《更强韧、更好、更快、更强》（HBFS）在其精确的BPM（每分钟节拍数）123.45中，包含了一个有意的彩蛋。尽管在线数据库通常将该曲的BPM列为123或123.48，但斯卡洛改进的节奏检测系统始终显示一个接近123.4的小数值。\n\n为了确定准确的BPM，斯卡洛采用了一种手动方法，他认为人类比大多数软件能更精确地确定节奏。他在音频应用中打开HBFS，识别出“首尾”节拍，测量了它们之间的精确时长（《探索》专辑CD抓轨版为216.282秒，YouTube版本为216.276秒），并数出了446个节拍（445个节拍间隔）。运用公式 `bpm = 60 * (节拍数 - 1) / 时长`，他计算出CD抓轨版的BPM为123.44994...，YouTube版本的BPM为123.45336...。这两个数值都几乎完美地四舍五入到123.45。\n\n为了探究这种有意性，斯卡洛研究了蠢朋克乐队在制作《探索》专辑（1999-2000年）时使用的设备。尽管他们使用的E-mu SP-1200和Akai MPC-3000音序器支持小数点后一位的BPM，但他们也使用的Emagic Logic Audio软件则支持到小数点后四位。尽管不清楚HBFS具体使用了哪种工具，但CD版本与精确的123.45惊人的接近，让斯卡洛相信这个带小数的节奏是一个故意的、幽默的细节，是这个“机器人二人组”埋下的一个“玩得漂亮”的隐藏秘密。"

    "summary": "The \"Neural Networks: Zero to Hero\" course by Andrej Karpathy guides learners through building neural networks from scratch in code, culminating in modern deep learning models like GPT. It uniquely focuses on language models, highlighting their excellent capacity for learning deep learning transferable skills. Prerequisites include solid Python programming and intro-level math.\n\nThe comprehensive syllabus begins with \"micrograd,\" offering a detailed, spelled-out explanation of neural networks and backpropagation. The \"makemore\" series follows, where participants build character-level language models. This progression starts with a bigram model, introduces `torch.Tensor`, then moves to a multilayer perceptron (MLP), covering essential machine learning concepts like training, learning rate tuning, and evaluation. Subsequent videos delve into MLP internals, analyzing activations and gradients, implementing Batch Normalization, and performing manual backpropagation to build deep intuition about gradient flow. The series also covers building a WaveNet-like convolutional neural network.\n\nThe course then tackles advanced projects, including building a Generatively Pretrained Transformer (GPT) from scratch, drawing from papers like \"Attention is All You Need.\" It concludes by constructing a GPT Tokenizer, explaining its crucial role in Large Language Models, its training (Byte Pair Encoding), and its impact on LLM behaviors. The course is described as \"ongoing,\" suggesting further content.",
