    "summary": "Notepad++ disclosed a state-sponsored attack, active from June to December 2, 2025, where its update traffic was hijacked. The incident involved an infrastructure-level compromise at Notepad++'s former shared hosting provider, not vulnerabilities in Notepad++ code. Malicious actors, likely a Chinese state-sponsored group, selectively redirected update requests for targeted users, exploiting insufficient update verification in older Notepad++ versions.\n\nThe hosting provider confirmed their server was compromised until September 2, 2025. Although direct server access was lost, attackers maintained internal service credentials until December 2, 2025, allowing continued traffic redirection. All remediation and security hardening by the provider concluded on this date.\n\nIn response, Notepad++ migrated its website to a new, more secure hosting provider. The Notepad++ updater (WinGup) was enhanced in v8.8.9 to verify both the certificate and signature of downloaded installers, with enforcement beginning in v8.9.2. Users are advised to manually update to v8.9.1. While the initial disclosure lacked Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), subsequent updates pointed to Rapid7 and Kaspersky providing more detailed technical information and IoCs. The author apologized for the incident.",

    "chinese_summary": "Notepad++披露了一起由国家支持的攻击，该攻击于2025年6月至12月2日期间持续活跃，其更新流量遭到劫持。该事件涉及Notepad++前共享主机提供商的基础设施层面遭到入侵，而非Notepad++代码中的漏洞。恶意行为者，很可能是一个中国国家支持的团体，有选择地重定向了目标用户的更新请求，利用了Notepad++旧版本中不足的更新验证机制。\n\n该主机提供商证实其服务器在2025年9月2日之前一直处于被入侵状态。尽管直接服务器访问权限已丢失，但攻击者仍持有内部服务凭证直至2025年12月2日，从而能够持续重定向流量。提供商的所有补救措施和安全强化工作都在此日期结束。\n\n作为回应，Notepad++将其网站迁移到了一个新的、更安全的主机提供商。Notepad++的更新器（WinGup）在v8.8.9版本中得到了增强，以验证下载的安装程序的证书和签名，并从v8.9.2版本开始强制执行。建议用户手动更新到v8.9.1版本。尽管最初的披露缺乏入侵指标（IoCs），但随后的更新指出Rapid7和卡巴斯基提供了更详细的技术信息和IoCs。作者对此次事件表示歉意。"

However, the provided content for the article is extremely brief, consisting solely of the word \"SpaceX.\"\n\nAs a result, the article does not offer any details, context, or explanation regarding the supposed merger or collaboration between xAI and SpaceX. It fails to provide information on when this event occurred, the nature of the \"joining,\" the implications for either company, or any further specifics beyond the initial claim made in the title.

    "summary": "The author, Ibrahim, switched to Dish Network in 2007 and acquired an RF remote, finding its line-of-sight-free operation amazing. However, a problem arose when a loud neighbor also subscribed to Dish Network and received an RF remote. The author's TV began randomly switching channels and volume, which he eventually traced to interference from the neighbor's identical remote operating on the same frequency.\n\nUpon realizing his RF remote could control the neighbor's TV, Ibrahim initially tried to be a good neighbor, intending to explain the frequency issue. However, the neighbor rudely dismissed him, slamming the door. Frustrated, Ibrahim decided on a different approach. He deactivated his own RF remote's functionality for his TV but kept the remote.\n\nHe then began a \"Pavlovian conditioning\" experiment: whenever the neighbor's TV volume exceeded an arbitrary threshold (around 15-20), Ibrahim would use his RF remote to turn off the neighbor's device. This routine continued for weeks, enduring late-night battles over volume. Eventually, the neighbor learned that keeping the volume below a certain level meant his TV would stay on. Ibrahim also applied this tactic to manage general noise from the neighbor's apartment during gatherings. The article concludes by humorously suggesting the neighbor now religiously sets his volume to 18, unknowingly due to Ibrahim's remote control.",

    "summary": "The article from Frommer's reports that the TSA's new $45 fee for travelers flying without an ID is considered illegal by regulatory expert and former government official, Robert Herbst.\n\nThe fee is charged to individuals who must undergo an alternative, lengthier security screening process because they lack a valid ID, such as a driver's license or passport. Herbst argues this fee is unlawful for several reasons:\n1.  **Unauthorized Collection:** The TSA lacks statutory authority from Congress to charge fees for security screenings. Its power is limited to specific charges like airport access control or credentialing.\n2.  **Double Taxation:** Travelers already pay a September 11 Security Fee as part of their airfare, making the $45 charge a \"tax on a tax\" for the same service.\n3.  **Undue Burden:** The fee disproportionately affects vulnerable populations who may not have easily accessible IDs, potentially restricting their right to travel.\n4.  **Lack of Transparency:** The fee was implemented without public notice, comment, or consultation, bypassing standard rulemaking procedures.\n5.  **Unconstitutional:** It may violate the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause by imposing an arbitrary charge without a clear legal basis.\n\nHerbst asserts that the TSA is overstepping its authority and that the fee should be challenged and rescinded.",

    "chinese_summary": "《弗罗默》杂志的文章报道称，监管专家、前政府官员罗伯特·赫布斯特（Robert Herbst）认为，运输安全管理局（TSA）向无证件旅行者收取的45美元新费用是非法的。\n\n该费用针对那些因缺乏有效身份证件（如驾照或护照）而必须接受替代性、耗时更长的安检程序的旅客。赫布斯特认为，该费用不合法有以下几个原因：\n1.  **未经授权的收费：** 运输安全管理局缺乏国会授权，无权收取安检费用。其权限仅限于机场出入控制或证件办理等特定收费。\n2.  **重复征税：** 旅客已在机票中支付了“9/11安全费”，这使得45美元的收费成为针对同一服务的“税上加税”。\n3.  **不当负担：** 该费用不成比例地影响那些可能难以获得证件的弱势群体，可能限制了他们的旅行权利。\n4.  **缺乏透明度：** 该费用在没有经过公众通知、评论或咨询的情况下实施，规避了标准的规章制定程序。\n5.  **违宪：** 该费用在没有明确法律依据的情况下征收任意费用，可能违反《第五修正案》的“正当程序条款”。\n\n赫布斯特坚称运输安全管理局越权行事，该费用应受到质疑并被废止。"

After 19 years, the creator cited mounting stress, unsustainable hours, and the inability to delegate or proactively move the project forward as key reasons for this decision. The demands of Anki's increasing popularity had led to burnout, taking a toll on his well-being and relationships.\n\nWhile previously resistant to investment offers due to concerns about compromising Anki's principles, he found AnkiHub to be a suitable partner. AnkiHub, which has had a symbiotic relationship with Anki for years by driving users through content and collaboration, approached him for closer cooperation. Recognizing AnkiHub's ability to scale faster and build an impressive team, he concluded they were better positioned to elevate Anki.\n\nThe transfer will involve a gradual transition of business operations and open-source stewardship, with strict provisions to ensure Anki remains open source and true to its foundational principles. The creator will remain involved with the project, albeit at a more sustainable level, seeing it as a \"step back\" rather than a complete departure. He is confident this change will be a net positive for the community, promising faster development, a more collaborative approach, UI improvements, and the removal of himself as a bottleneck, thereby securing Anki's future growth and stability.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration, in its second term, has significantly disrupted federal data collection and public access across numerous critical areas, with experts estimating over 3,000 datasets have been removed or restricted. This overhaul has rendered the federal government an unreliable source of comprehensive data.\n\nKey examples of these changes include the complete elimination of the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN), termination of household food security reports, and suspension of maternal and infant mortality data (PRAMS) following CDC staff layoffs. The administration also halted a database tracking federal law enforcement misconduct, removed gender identity questions from vital surveys, and ended public access to infrastructure data. Agencies like the IRS and Education Department have ceased allowing researchers access to their data, and data-related staffing at agencies such as the National Center for Education Statistics and the Energy Information Administration has seen drastic reductions.\n\nThese actions, sometimes justified by the administration as reducing redundancy or \"quelling gender ideology extremism,\" have created significant gaps. Researchers and policymakers now struggle to track policy outcomes, identify disparities in public health, substance abuse, and LGBTQ+ issues, and make informed decisions. Organizations reliant on federal data for planning, policymaking, and securing funding, from Feeding America to homeless shelters, are severely impacted. Critics warn that these disruptions undermine a basic governmental function, leaving the nation less prepared for future challenges and diminishing global reliance on American-led science.",
