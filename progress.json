    "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/26/tech/tiktok-ice-censorship-glitch-cec",
    "summary": "TikTok users are reporting difficulties uploading videos critical of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), particularly following the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by a federal agent. Comedian Megan Stalter and nurse Jen Hamilton, among others, experienced repeated failures when attempting to post anti-ICE content, with Stalter ultimately deleting her account, suspecting censorship.\n\nTikTok attributes these upload issues to technical glitches stemming from a power outage at a US data center, stating they are \"unrelated\" to recent events or content. However, this explanation is met with skepticism, especially given recent changes in TikTok's US ownership. A majority American-owned joint venture, including Oracle (whose executive chair has ties to the Trump administration), recently took control of the platform’s US operations, overseeing content moderation and user data.\n\nExperts like Professor Casey Fiesler note a \"significant lack of trust\" in social media platforms, exacerbated by TikTok's new leadership and its perceived connections to the government, particularly regarding ICE. While proving intentional censorship is difficult due to TikTok’s opaque algorithm, the perception itself is eroding user trust. Jeffrey Blevins, a media law expert, clarifies that as a private platform, TikTok legally can moderate content.\n\nThe controversy has led to a surge in TikTok uninstalls, with some users seeking alternative platforms. Others, like Jen Hamilton, are adapting by using \"coded\" language to discuss sensitive topics, believing the obstacles are designed to silence narratives contrary to government interests. The situation underscores broader concerns about content moderation, data privacy, and free speech on major social media platforms under new ownership.",
    "chinese_title": "抖音用户无法上传反ICE视频。该公司归咎于技术问题。",
    "chinese_summary": "TikTok用户报告称，在联邦特工枪杀亚历克斯·普雷蒂（Alex Pretti）事件后，他们上传批评移民和海关执法局（ICE）的视频时遇到了困难。喜剧演员梅根·斯塔尔特（Megan Stalter）和护士珍·汉密尔顿（Jen Hamilton）等人，在尝试发布反ICE内容时反复失败，斯塔尔特最终删除了她的账户，怀疑遭到审查。\n\nTikTok将这些上传问题归咎于美国数据中心停电导致的技术故障，并声明这些问题与近期事件或内容“无关”。然而，这一解释遭到了质疑，尤其是考虑到TikTok在美国的所有权近期发生了变化。一个由多数美国公司持股的合资企业，其中包括甲骨文公司（其执行董事长与特朗普政府有联系），最近接管了该平台在美国的运营，负责监督内容审核和用户数据。\n\n凯西·菲斯勒（Casey Fiesler）教授等专家指出，人们对社交媒体平台“严重缺乏信任”，而TikTok的新领导层及其与政府（特别是ICE）的关联，加剧了这种不信任感。尽管由于TikTok不透明的算法，很难证明存在蓄意审查，但这种看法本身正在侵蚀用户信任。媒体法专家杰弗里·布莱文斯（Jeffrey Blevins）澄清说，作为私人平台，TikTok在法律上可以审核内容。\n\n这场争议导致TikTok卸载量激增，一些用户正在寻找替代平台。另一些人，如珍·汉密尔顿，则通过使用“暗语”讨论敏感话题来适应，他们认为这些障碍旨在压制与政府利益相悖的叙事。这一局面凸显了在新所有权下，主要社交媒体平台在内容审核、数据隐私和言论自由方面存在的更广泛担忧。"

    "url": "https://atmoio.substack.com/p/after-two-years-of-vibecoding-im",
    "summary": "The author reflects on two years of \"vibecoding,\" a term describing a period of intense, often superficial, digital output driven by a culture valuing speed and quantity over quality. This involved rapidly generating notes, articles, and code, akin to \"shitting out\" digital content to capture fleeting ideas or \"vibes.\" The author found this process led to burnout, a sense of disconnect, and work that felt insubstantial and easily forgotten, like \"sand in my hands.\"\n\nAfter experiencing the shallowness and lack of permanence in this digital deluge, the author made a conscious return to writing by hand. This shift is presented as an antidote to the perceived drawbacks of \"vibecoding.\" Handwriting, for the author, is an embodied, slow, and deliberate process that forces deeper thought and clarity. It connects the mind to the body, making ideas feel more \"real\" and \"sticky.\"\n\nUsing tools like Lamy Safaris with fine nibs and Midori MD Notebooks, the author finds that handwriting fosters a more profound connection to their work, leading to higher quality output and a renewed sense of purpose. It allows for a slower, more intentional engagement with ideas, creating tangible artifacts that contrast with the fleeting nature of digital notes. While not abandoning digital tools entirely, handwriting has become the primary method for initial thought generation and drafting, enabling a deeper interface with their \"inner world\" and reclaiming intellectual autonomy from the pressures of digital productivity.",
    "chinese_title": "写了两年代码之后，我又开始手写了。",

    "url": "https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/america-fascism-trump-maga-ice/685751/",
    "summary": "The author, initially hesitant to label President Trump and the MAGA movement as \"fascist\" due to the term's overuse and ill-definition, now asserts it is the most accurate description. Previously, the author characterized Trump's governing style as \"patrimonialism\"—treating the state as personal property—but now identifies a more sinister shift towards doctrinal and operational fascism. This conclusion stems not from isolated incidents but from a \"constellation of characteristics\" that, viewed together, reveal a clear pattern.\n\nThese characteristics include: the deliberate demolition of civic norms and liberal pieties to unleash \"dark passions\"; the glorification of violence, praising mobs, and endorsing torture; the belief that \"might is right,\" asserting the strong dominate the weak; the politicization of law enforcement to persecute enemies and shield allies, rejecting due process; the dehumanization of opponents and immigrants with language akin to the Third Reich; the deployment of police-state tactics through agencies like ICE, expanding their power and encouraging brutality; efforts to undermine elections and a refusal to accept defeat; the commandeering of private entities, blurring public and private sectors; relentless attacks on news media, labeling them \"enemies of the people\"; predatory territorial and military aggression, disrespecting international law; transnational support for authoritarian regimes globally; and the promotion of a \"blood-and-soil\" nationalism, explicitly favoring a whiter, more Christian America and rejecting birthright citizenship. The author concludes that this totality of actions demonstrates a governing model consistent with fascism.",
    "chinese_title": "是的，这就是法西斯主义。",
    "chinese_summary": "作者起初因“法西斯”一词被滥用且定义模糊而迟疑，不愿将特朗普总统和“让美国再次伟大”运动贴上“法西斯”的标签，但现在断言这是最准确的描述。此前，作者曾将特朗普的执政风格描述为“家产制”（即将国家视为私人财产），但现在发现了更险恶的转变，即转向了教条化和操作性的法西斯主义。这一结论并非源于孤立事件，而是源于一系列特征的集合，这些特征综合起来，揭示出一个清晰的模式。\n\n这些特征包括：蓄意破坏公民规范和自由主义信条，以释放“黑暗的激情”；颂扬暴力，赞扬暴徒，认可酷刑；相信“强权即公理”，宣称强者主宰弱者；将执法政治化，以迫害敌人和庇护盟友，拒绝正当程序；使用类似于第三帝国（纳粹德国）的语言对对手和移民进行非人化对待；通过移民和海关执法局（ICE）等机构部署警察国家手段，扩大其权力并鼓励残暴行为；破坏选举的努力以及拒绝接受失败；征用私营实体，模糊公共和私人部门界限；对新闻媒体进行无情攻击，将其诬蔑为“人民的敌人”；掠夺性领土和军事侵略，无视国际法；在全球范围内跨国支持威权政权；以及宣扬“血与土”的民族主义，明确偏袒一个更白人化、更基督教化的美国，并拒绝出生公民权。作者总结道，所有这些行动共同表明了一种与法西斯主义相符的执政模式。"

    "summary": "Today, January 26, 2026, marks the 100th anniversary of television's first public demonstration by Scottish inventor John Logie Baird. While early experiments occurred elsewhere, notably in Hastings where Baird built his first transmitter using household items and achieved the first image (a St Johns Ambulance medal shadow) in 1923, the decisive moment was in London.\n\nIn November 1924, Baird moved to 22 Frith Street, Soho, setting up a workshop above an Italian cafe. After demonstrating his electro-mechanical \"Televisor\" at Selfridges, he honed his process. By October 1925, he transmitted images with gradations of light and shade, famously using a dummy \"Stooky Bill\" and then, 20-year-old William Taynton, who became the first human subject to be televised.\n\nThe official demonstration to the press and Royal Institution members took place on January 26, 1926, at Frith Street, showcasing the dummy and then transmitted human faces. Although many present didn't grasp its significance, The Times reported on Baird's invention.\n\nBaird continued innovating, developing colour television, stereoscopic (3D) TV, and infra-red TV by 1928. He initiated experimental BBC transmissions in 1930. However, when broadcast television launched in 1936, his mechanical system competed with Marconi-EMI's superior electronic system and was dropped after three months.\n\nDespite his star waning due to competition and wartime disruptions, Baird is remembered for making television possible. Today, 22 Frith Street, now Bar Italia, is recognized with plaques as a \"World Origin Site\" for live television, celebrating Baird's pioneering contribution that led to television becoming a transformative invention of the 20th century.",
