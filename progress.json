    "summary": "Starting in March, Discord will implement a global age verification system, setting all user accounts to a \"teen-appropriate experience\" by default. To access full features, including age-restricted servers and channels, users must verify they are adults.\n\nDiscord's age inference model will initially try to determine a user's age using factors like account tenure, device and activity data, and community patterns, but explicitly states it does not use private messages. If this model cannot confirm adult status, or if users wish to bypass the teen-default settings, they will need to complete an age check.\n\nVerification options include using AI-powered facial age estimation, which analyzes a video selfie on the user's device and is then deleted. Alternatively, users can submit a photo of a government ID to a third-party vendor, with the image also being deleted immediately after verification. Discord emphasizes it is facial *estimation*, not biometric scanning or facial recognition, and does not store personal information from IDs. A new vendor is in use following a past data breach.\n\nUnverified users will be unable to access age-restricted content, speak in \"stage\" channels, and will encounter content filters and warnings for unfamiliar contacts. This rollout is driven by international legal pushes for child safety. Discord expects a minimal impact for most users, as it primarily affects access to explicit or graphic content, though some user attrition is anticipated.",

    "chinese_summary": "自三月起，Discord 将在全球范围内实施年龄验证系统，默认将所有用户账户设置为“青少年适宜体验”。要访问完整功能，包括受年龄限制的服务器和频道，用户必须验证其为成年人。\n\nDiscord 的年龄推断模型将首先尝试使用账户使用时长、设备和活动数据以及社区模式等因素来确定用户的年龄，但明确声明不使用私人消息。如果此模型无法确认成年状态，或者用户希望绕过青少年默认设置，他们将需要完成年龄验证。\n\n验证选项包括使用AI驱动的面部年龄估算，它会在用户的设备上分析一段视频自拍，然后被删除。另外，用户可以将政府身份证件照片提交给第三方供应商，该图像在验证后也会立即删除。Discord 强调这只是面部*估算*，而非生物识别扫描或人脸识别，且不存储身份证件中的个人信息。由于过去发生过数据泄露，目前正在使用新的供应商。\n\n未经验证的用户将无法访问受年龄限制的内容，无法在“舞台”频道发言，并会遇到针对陌生联系人的内容过滤和警告。此次推行是受到国际上推动儿童安全的法律要求驱动的。Discord 预计这对大多数用户的影响很小，因为它主要影响对露骨或图像内容的访问，尽管预计会有部分用户流失。"

    "url": "https://explainers.blog/posts/why-is-the-sky-blue/",
    "summary": "The article elucidates why various skies and atmospheric phenomena appear in specific colors. Earth's blue sky is due to Rayleigh scattering: small nitrogen and oxygen molecules preferentially scatter high-frequency blue and violet light because their frequencies are closer to the molecules' resonant frequencies. We see blue over violet because human eyes are less sensitive to violet.\n\nSunsets are red because sunlight travels through a greater atmospheric depth at low angles, scattering almost all blue and green light away before it reaches our eyes, leaving primarily red and orange.\n\nClouds appear white because they are made of much larger water droplets than gas molecules. These droplets scatter all visible wavelengths of light roughly equally, akin to tiny prisms, resulting in a white appearance.\n\nMars's sky is red because its atmosphere contains pervasive, iron-rich dust particles. These particles absorb blue and violet light, scattering red, orange, and yellow light throughout the sky. However, Martian sunsets are blue because these dust particles *forward-scatter* blue light more effectively directly towards the observer when viewing the sun, creating a blue halo around the setting sun despite the overall blue absorption in the atmosphere.\n\nIn essence, atmospheric color depends on particle size, resonant frequencies, and light path length, determining whether light is preferentially scattered, absorbed, or transmitted.",
    "chinese_title": "为什么天空是蓝色的？",
    "chinese_summary": "本文阐明了为何各种天空和大气现象呈现特定颜色。地球的蓝天是瑞利散射造成的：小型氮分子和氧分子优先散射高频的蓝色和紫色光，因为这些光的频率更接近分子的共振频率。我们看到蓝色而非紫色，是因为人眼对紫色不那么敏感。\n\n日落呈红色是因为太阳光在低角度时穿过更厚的大气层，在到达我们眼睛之前几乎所有的蓝色和绿色光都被散射掉了，主要留下红色和橙色。\n\n云朵呈白色是因为它们由比气体分子大得多的水滴组成。这些水滴大致均匀地散射所有可见光波长，类似于微小的棱镜，因此呈现白色。\n\n火星天空呈红色是因为其大气中弥漫着富含铁的尘埃颗粒。这些颗粒吸收蓝色和紫色光，将红色、橙色和黄色光散射到整个天空中。然而，火星日落呈蓝色，是因为当观察者观看太阳时，这些尘埃颗粒能更有效地将蓝光*前向散射*到观察者眼中，在落日周围形成一个蓝色光晕，尽管大气层整体上吸收蓝色光。\n\n本质上，大气颜色取决于颗粒大小、共振频率和光程长度，这些因素决定了光是否被优先散射、吸收或透射。"

    "title": "Art of Roads in Games",
    "url": "https://sandboxspirit.com/blog/art-of-roads-in-games/",
    "summary": "The author finds a primal satisfaction in observing intricate patterns, from natural phenomena like ant colonies to human-made road networks, viewing them as sophisticated designs. This lifelong fascination translated into an obsession with roads in city-builder games, starting with SimCity 2000 and progressing through Cities: Skylines and its mods. Despite increasing freedom and realism in game development, the author always felt something was \"off\" – unrealistic highway ramps, sharp bends, and strange intersection radii.\n\nThe fundamental issue, the author discovered, lies in game developers' use of Bezier splines. While elegant for general curves, Bezier splines fail to preserve shape and curvature when offset, leading to \"pinching\" and self-intersecting geometry. This contradicts how real-world vehicle wheels maintain a constant parallel distance.\n\nA better, more mathematically sound approach for roads involves circular arcs, which perfectly preserve parallelism when offset and simplify curve-curve intersection calculations, making them ideal for urban intersections. For high-speed roads, civil engineers utilize \"transition curves\" like the clothoid, which gradually increase curvature, providing a smooth, comfortable ride, though these are significantly more complex mathematically.\n\nThe author's motivation for delving into these technicalities, even if unnoticed by most players, stems from curiosity, a desire to challenge the status quo, and the lack of robust road-building solutions for indie developers. He intends to share his custom-built road system, which will be detailed in a future technical post.",

    "chinese_summary": "作者在观察错综复杂的图案时获得一种原始的满足感，无论是像蚁群这样的自然现象，还是人工修建的道路网络，他都将它们视为精巧的设计。这种毕生的着迷演变成了他对城市建造游戏中道路的痴迷，从《模拟城市2000》开始，一直到《城市：天际线》及其模组。尽管游戏开发中自由度和真实性不断提高，作者却总是觉得有些“不对劲”——不真实的公路匝道、急弯和奇怪的交叉路口半径。\n\n作者发现，根本问题在于游戏开发者使用了贝塞尔曲线。贝塞尔曲线在处理一般曲线时显得优美，但在偏移时却无法保持形状和曲率，导致几何形状出现“挤压”和自相交。这与现实世界中车辆车轮保持恒定平行距离的方式相悖。\n\n一种更好、数学上更严谨的道路方法是使用圆弧，它们在偏移时能完美保持平行性，并简化曲线与曲线的交叉点计算，使其成为城市交叉路口的理想选择。对于高速公路，土木工程师会使用像回旋曲线这样的“缓和曲线”，它们能逐渐增加曲率，提供平稳、舒适的行驶体验，尽管这些在数学上要复杂得多。\n\n作者深入研究这些技术细节的动机，即使大多数玩家可能没有注意到，源于好奇心、挑战现状的愿望，以及独立开发者缺乏强大的道路建造解决方案。他打算分享他自定义构建的道路系统，该系统将在未来的技术文章中详细介绍。"

    "summary": "This project details converting an inexpensive $3.88 analog quartz clock into an ESP8266-based Wi-Fi clock that synchronizes with an NTP server.\n\nThe core hardware involves a WEMOS D1 Mini ESP8266 module and a modified analog clock movement.

If the analog clock lags, the ESP8266 advances its second hand by sending bipolar pulses to the Lavet motor coil; it cannot move the hands backward.

To overcome this, a Microchip 47L04 Serial EERAM stores the precise positions of the hour, minute, and second hands every second.

    "summary": "The article \"AI makes the easy part easier and the hard part harder\" by Blundergoat explores the paradoxical impact of artificial intelligence on professional work, particularly in creative and knowledge-based fields.\n\nThe author posits that AI excels at automating and accelerating routine, formulaic, and foundational tasks—the \"easy part\" of many jobs. This includes generating boilerplate code, drafting basic content, or summarizing information, effectively making initial drafts and mundane work much faster and less effortful.\n\nHowever, this efficiency paradoxically makes the \"hard part\" of human work more challenging and demanding. By handling the routine, AI elevates expectations for human output, pushing professionals to focus exclusively on genuinely novel, strategic, and deeply creative tasks. Humans are now expected to deliver unique insights, complex problem-solving, and truly innovative ideas, as AI can handle the \"good enough.\"\n\nFurthermore, interacting with AI introduces new complexities. Professionals must develop skills in prompting AI effectively, critically evaluating its output for nuance and accuracy, and integrating AI-generated content into a coherent whole. This requires heightened discernment and expertise to identify subtle errors or limitations that AI might produce. Ultimately, AI shifts the human role towards oversight, refinement, and the pursuit of truly exceptional and uniquely human contributions, making the apex of human creativity and strategic thinking even more critical and arduous.",
