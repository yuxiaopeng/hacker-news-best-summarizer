    "url": "https://noheger.at/blog/2026/01/11/the-struggle-of-resizing-windows-on-macos-tahoe/",
    "summary": "The article criticizes macOS Tahoe's \"absurdly large\" window corner radii, which are deemed aesthetically displeasing and, more significantly, detrimental to usability. The author, a long-time computer user, notes a new struggle with resizing windows since upgrading.\n\nThis difficulty stems from the fact that macOS windows expect resize clicks within a 19x19 pixel target area near the corner. In previous macOS versions with sharp corners, 62% of this area was inside the visible window. However, due to Tahoe's pronounced corner radius, 75% of this critical target area now lies *outside* the visible window boundary.\n\nUsers instinctively attempt to grab the window corner *inside* the visible shape, a natural action that aligns with how one would physically grasp an object. Yet, in Tahoe, these intuitive click points often fall outside the accepted resize zone, leading to failed attempts. Paradoxically, the most reliable way to resize a window in Tahoe is to click and drag *outside* the visible corner. This required gesture feels unnatural, counter-intuitive, and ultimately error-prone, turning a basic computing task into a frustrating experience due to a design choice.",

    "chinese_summary": "文章批评macOS Tahoe“大得离谱”的窗口圆角半径，认为其不仅在美学上令人不悦，更重要的是损害了可用性。作为一名资深电脑用户，作者指出自升级以来，调整窗口大小变得异常困难。\n\n这种困难源于macOS窗口期望调整大小的点击发生在角落附近一个19x19像素的目标区域内。在之前具有尖角的macOS版本中，该区域的62%都位于可见窗口内部。然而，由于Tahoe版本显著的圆角设计，这个关键目标区域的75%现在位于可见窗口边界*之外*。\n\n用户本能地试图在窗口可见形状*内部*抓取其角落，这是一个与人们物理抓取物体方式相符的自然动作。然而，在Tahoe中，这些直观的点击点却经常落在被接受的调整大小区域之外，导致尝试失败。矛盾的是，在Tahoe中调整窗口大小最可靠的方法是点击并拖动可见角落*之外*的区域。这种所需的操作手势令人感觉不自然、反直觉，并且最终容易出错，由于这一设计选择，将一个基本的计算任务变成了一种令人沮丧的体验。"

    "summary": "On January 11, 2026, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell announced that the Department of Justice served him with grand jury subpoenas, threatening a criminal indictment. The stated reason for this action relates to his testimony last June before the Senate Banking Committee, concerning a renovation project of Federal Reserve office buildings.\n\nPowell, while affirming his respect for the rule of law, described this as an \"unprecedented action\" that he sees within a broader context of the current administration's threats and pressure. He explicitly states that the threat of criminal charges is not truly about his testimony or the renovations, which he considers \"pretexts.\"\n\nInstead, Powell believes this move is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates independently, based on economic evidence and public service, rather than adhering to the President's preferences. He frames the situation as a critical challenge to the Fed's ability to conduct monetary policy free from political pressure or intimidation.\n\nPowell, having served under multiple administrations, reaffirmed his commitment to his duties without political fear or favor, focusing solely on the Fed's mandate of price stability and maximum employment. He vowed to continue serving the American people with integrity despite the threats.",

    "url": "https://mitchellh.com/writing/ghostty-memory-leak-fix",
    "summary": "Ghostty, a terminal emulator, was suffering from a severe memory leak, with some users reporting up to 37 GB consumption. The bug, present since Ghostty 1.0, became prominent recently due to applications like Claude Code generating specific output patterns.\n\nThe core issue lay in Ghostty's `PageList` memory management. It uses a doubly-linked list of memory pages, employing a pool for standard-sized pages and `mmap` for larger, \"non-standard\" pages. A key optimization involved reusing the oldest scrollback page when the history limit was reached, preventing costly reallocations.\n\nThe bug occurred when a non-standard page, allocated directly via `mmap`, was reused during scrollback pruning. While the page's metadata was reset to a standard size, the underlying `mmap` allocation was not resized. Consequently, when this page was later \"freed,\" Ghostty's logic incorrectly assumed it was a standard pooled page and failed to call `munmap`, leading to a memory leak. Claude Code's CLI exacerbated this by frequently producing multi-codepoint grapheme outputs, forcing the regular use of non-standard pages in high-scrollback scenarios.\n\nThe fix is conceptually simple: non-standard pages are no longer reused during scrollback pruning. Instead, they are properly `munmap`'d, and a fresh standard-sized page is allocated from the pool.\n\nDiagnosing the leak was aided by adding virtual memory tags on macOS, allowing PageList memory to be specifically identified and monitored. While Ghostty has various leak detection mechanisms (e.g., leak-detecting allocators, Valgrind, Instruments), this particular bug evaded them due to its very specific trigger conditions, which are now covered by a new test. This was Ghostty's largest reported memory leak, and its resolution highlights the importance of real-world reproduction scenarios for diagnostics.",
    "chinese_title": "发现并修复 Ghostty 的最大内存泄漏",
    "chinese_summary": "Ghostty，一个终端模拟器，正遭受严重的内存泄漏问题，有用户报告内存占用高达37 GB。这个自Ghostty 1.0版本以来就存在的漏洞，最近由于Claude Code等应用程序生成特定的输出模式而变得突出。\n\n核心问题在于Ghostty的`PageList`内存管理。它使用一个内存页的双向链表，对标准大小的页采用内存池，而对更大的“非标准”页则使用`mmap`。一个关键的优化是当达到历史记录限制时，重用最旧的回滚页，以避免昂贵的重新分配。\n\n这个漏洞发生在一个通过`mmap`直接分配的非标准页在回滚修剪期间被重用时。虽然页面的元数据被重置为标准大小，但底层的`mmap`分配并未调整大小。因此，当该页面随后被“释放”时，Ghostty的逻辑错误地认为它是一个标准池化页面，未能调用`munmap`，从而导致内存泄漏。Claude Code的命令行界面通过频繁生成多代码点字素输出加剧了这一问题，在高回滚场景中强制常规使用非标准页。\n\n修复方案在概念上很简单：非标准页在回滚修剪期间不再被重用。相反，它们被正确地`munmap`，并从池中分配一个新的标准大小的页面。\n\n在macOS上添加虚拟内存标签有助于诊断此泄漏，从而能够专门识别和监控PageList内存。尽管Ghostty具有各种泄漏检测机制（例如，泄漏检测分配器、Valgrind、Instruments），但这个特定的漏洞由于其非常具体的触发条件而避开了这些机制，现在这些条件已被新的测试覆盖。这是Ghostty报告过的最大内存泄漏，其解决凸显了真实世界复现场景对于诊断的重要性。"
