    "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/14/fbi-raid-washington-post-hannah-natanson",
    "summary": "The FBI raided the Virginia home of Washington Post reporter Hannah Natanson early Wednesday, seizing her phone, two laptops, and a Garmin watch. The newspaper labeled the action \"highly unusual and aggressive,\" while press freedom groups universally condemned it as a \"tremendous intrusion\" and an \"alarming escalation\" against the independent press by the Trump administration.\n\nThe raid is linked to an investigation into Aurelio Perez-Lugones, a government contractor accused of illegally retaining classified materials. Natanson, who covers the federal workforce and built a network of federal employee sources, was reportedly told she is not the focus of the investigation and faces no accusations of wrongdoing.\n\nWashington Post executive editor Matt Murray expressed profound concern, stressing the constitutional protections for journalistic work. Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the raid, stating it was requested by the Pentagon on a journalist \"obtaining and reporting classified and illegally leaked information,\" and warned against illegal leaks that pose national security risks. She noted the \"leaker is currently behind bars,\" although the criminal complaint against Perez-Lugones does not accuse him of leaking.\n\nPress freedom organizations, including the Reporters' Committee for Freedom of the Press and the Knight First Amendment Institute, voiced outrage. They emphasized that such invasive searches endanger confidential sources, impede public interest reporting, and undermine First Amendment rights, calling for a public explanation from the Justice Department. Seth Stern of the Freedom of the Press Foundation called it \"an alarming escalation in the Trump administration’s multipronged war on press freedom.\"",

    "chinese_summary": "联邦调查局（FBI）周三凌晨突袭了《华盛顿邮报》记者汉娜·纳坦森（Hannah Natanson）位于弗吉尼亚州的住所，查获了她的手机、两台笔记本电脑和一块佳明（Garmin）手表。该报称此举“极不寻常且具有侵略性”，而新闻自由组织则普遍谴责这是“巨大的侵犯”，并称之为特朗普政府对独立媒体“令人震惊的升级”。\n\n此次突袭与针对政府承包商奥雷利奥·佩雷斯-卢戈内斯（Aurelio Perez-Lugones）的调查有关，后者被指控非法保留机密材料。据报道，纳坦森主要报道联邦劳动力并建立了联邦雇员消息来源网络，她被告知自己并非调查的重点，也没有面临任何不当行为的指控。\n\n《华盛顿邮报》执行主编马特·默里（Matt Murray）表达了深切关注，强调了新闻工作受到的宪法保护。司法部长帕姆·邦迪（Pam Bondi）为此次突袭辩护，称其是应五角大楼要求，针对一名“获取并报道机密和非法泄露信息”的记者进行的，并警告称非法泄露会带来国家安全风险。她指出“泄密者目前已被关押”，尽管针对佩雷斯-卢戈内斯的刑事诉讼并未指控他泄密。\n\n包括记者自由委员会和奈特第一修正案研究所在内的新闻自由组织表达了愤慨。他们强调，这种侵入性搜查会危及机密消息来源，阻碍公共利益报道，并损害第一修正案权利，呼吁司法部作出公开解释。新闻自由基金会的塞思·斯特恩（Seth Stern）称其为“特朗普政府对新闻自由进行多方面战争中令人震惊的升级”。"

    "url": "https://www.promptarmor.com/resources/claude-cowork-exfiltrates-files",
    "summary": "Anthropic's new AI agent, Claude Cowork, is vulnerable to file exfiltration via indirect prompt injection, leveraging unremediated isolation flaws in Claude's code execution environment. This vulnerability, initially discovered by Johann Rehberger in Claude.ai, was acknowledged but not fixed by Anthropic and now extends to Cowork.\n\nThe article criticizes Anthropic's warning to users about \"suspicious actions\" as unrealistic for non-technical individuals. The demonstrated attack chain involves a victim connecting Cowork to local files and then uploading a seemingly innocuous document (e.g., a .docx disguised as a 'Skill') containing a hidden prompt injection. This injection is concealed using tactics like 1-point, white-on-white text, making it virtually undetectable.\n\nWhen the victim prompts Cowork to analyze their files using this malicious 'skill,' the hidden injection manipulates Cowork to execute a `curl` command. This command uploads the victim's local files, potentially containing sensitive financial data and PII, to the attacker's Anthropic account via the allowlisted Anthropic API. Crucially, this exfiltration occurs without any human approval.\n\nThe exploit was successfully demonstrated on Claude Haiku and also replicated on Claude Opus 4.5 in Cowork. The article also notes that Claude's API is susceptible to denial-of-service attacks from malformed files. Furthermore, Cowork's broad access to a user's day-to-day work environment (browsers, servers, AppleScripts via Connectors) significantly expands the attack surface for prompt injection, increasing the risk of processing untrusted and sensitive data.",

    "chinese_summary": "Anthropic的新AI代理Claude Cowork容易受到通过间接提示注入进行的文件外泄攻击，这利用了Claude代码执行环境中未修复的隔离缺陷。此漏洞最初由Johann Rehberger在Claude.ai中发现，Anthropic承认但未修复，现在也扩展到了Cowork。\n\n文章批评Anthropic向用户发出的关于“可疑行为”的警告，认为这对非技术人员来说是不切实际的。演示的攻击链涉及受害者将Cowork连接到本地文件，然后上传一个看似无害的文档（例如，伪装成“技能”的.docx文件），该文档包含一个隐藏的提示注入。这种注入通过使用1点大小、白底白字等策略进行隐藏，使其几乎无法被检测到。\n\n当受害者提示Cowork使用这个恶意“技能”分析他们的文件时，隐藏的注入会操纵Cowork执行一个`curl`命令。该命令会将受害者的本地文件（可能包含敏感财务数据和个人身份信息）通过白名单中的Anthropic API上传到攻击者的Anthropic账户。至关重要的是，这种数据外泄是在没有任何人工批准的情况下发生的。\n\n该漏洞已在Claude Haiku上成功演示，并在Cowork中的Claude Opus 4.5上重现。文章还指出，Claude的API容易受到来自格式错误文件的拒绝服务攻击。此外，Cowork对用户日常工作环境（通过连接器访问浏览器、服务器、AppleScript）的广泛访问，显著扩大了提示注入的攻击面，增加了处理不受信任和敏感数据的风险。"

    "url": "https://electrek.co/2026/01/13/ford-f150-lightning-outsold-tesla-cybertruck-canceled-not-selling-enough/",
    "summary": "The article highlights the precarious state of the Tesla Cybertruck program, noting that the Ford F-150 Lightning, despite being canceled for poor sales, still outsold the Cybertruck in 2025.\n\nTesla's Cybertruck sales performance is difficult to ascertain due to the company bundling it under \"Other Models.\" However, calculations suggest only around 5,500 Cybertrucks were sold globally in Q4 2025, leading to an estimated 21,500 for the entire year. This represents a nearly 50% year-over-year crash in sales and is only about 10% of its stated production capacity. Attempts to boost sales with price cuts and cheaper trims have failed, and even a purchase of over 1,000 units by SpaceX in Q4 couldn't prevent the decline.\n\nIn contrast, the Ford F-150 Lightning delivered approximately 27,300 units in the US in 2025 before its December cancellation. Even as a \"lame duck\" product, it surpassed the Cybertruck's global sales.\n\nThe author, Fred Lambert, criticizes Tesla's and Elon Musk's handling of the Cybertruck, attributing its struggles to Musk's ego, \"toxic brand,\" and refusal to admit defeat. He suggests distancing from Musk and abandoning costly 4680 cells could improve sales, but sees little hope for the program as it currently stands. The article also mentions Musk's abandonment of other projects like the Model 2 and Roadster, and concerns about the proposed Cybercab.",

    "chinese_summary": "文章强调了特斯拉Cybertruck项目岌岌可危的境地，指出尽管福特F-150 Lightning因销量不佳被取消，但在2025年其销量仍超过了Cybertruck。\n\n特斯拉Cybertruck的销售表现难以确定，因为该公司将其归入“其他车型”类别。然而，计算表明2025年第四季度全球Cybertruck销量仅约5,500辆，全年估计为21,500辆。这代表销量同比暴跌近50%，且仅为其公布产能的约10%。通过降价和推出廉价版车型来提振销量的尝试均告失败，甚至SpaceX在第四季度购买了1000多辆也未能阻止销量下滑。\n\n相比之下，福特F-150 Lightning在2025年12月被取消前，在美国交付了约27,300辆。即便作为一款即将停产的产品，其销量仍超越了Cybertruck的全球销量。\n\n作者弗雷德·兰伯特批评特斯拉和埃隆·马斯克对Cybertruck的处理方式，将其困境归因于马斯克的自负、“有毒品牌”以及拒绝认输。他建议，与马斯克保持距离并放弃昂贵的4680电池有望改善销量，但他认为该项目目前状况下希望渺茫。文章还提到马斯克放弃了Model 2和Roadster等其他项目，以及对拟议中的Cybercab的担忧。"

This tool reportedly populates a map with individuals, provides a dossier on each, and assigns a \"confidence score\" to their current addresses, allowing ICE to identify areas with a high concentration of people they might detain.\n\nThe findings are based on internal ICE materials obtained by 404 Media, public procurement records, and recent sworn testimony from an ICE official, establishing a clear link between Palantir's technology and ICE's operational activities. The tool allegedly receives address information from various sources, including the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).\n\nThis news emerges amidst increased federal presence in Minneapolis, with Department of Homeland Security (DHS) head Kristi Noem dispatching additional agents following widespread protests.
