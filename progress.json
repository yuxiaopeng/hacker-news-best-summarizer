    "summary": "Anna's Archive, primarily known for text preservation, has undertaken a significant project to back up Spotify's music library, creating the \"world's first preservation archive\" for music. This initiative addresses gaps in existing music archives, which often neglect less popular tracks or focus solely on high-quality files, making comprehensive preservation difficult.\n\nThe archive includes metadata for 256 million tracks (99.9% of Spotify) and 86 million music files, representing approximately 99.6% of total listens, amounting to around 300TB. This makes it the largest publicly available music metadata database, featuring 186 million unique ISRCs.\n\nThe collection is distributed in bulk torrents, prioritized by Spotify's popularity metric. Tracks with popularity > 0 are preserved in their original OGG Vorbis 160kbit/s quality, with metadata added without re-encoding. Tracks with popularity = 0 are re-encoded to OGG Opus 75kbit/s, covering about half of those tracks. All metadata is provided in queryable SQLite databases.\n\nDesigned to be fully open and easily mirrorable, the archive aims to safeguard humanity's musical heritage. Anna's Archive encourages donations and torrent seeding to support this preservation effort. The extensive metadata also enables functionalities like a \"true shuffle\" across Spotify's entire catalog.",

    "summary": "CSS Grid Lanes, introduced on Dec 19, 2025, marks a significant step forward for web layouts, especially for native masonry-style designs. After years of development and debate, it offers a robust solution for dynamically arranging content.\n\nTo implement, developers use `display: grid-lanes` on a container. Lanes are then defined using `grid-template-columns` or `grid-template-rows`, harnessing the full power of CSS Grid for flexible, responsive layouts. For example, `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(250px, 1fr))` creates responsive columns that fill available space, requiring no media queries.\n\nKey features include the ability to create varying lane sizes, span items across multiple lanes (`grid-column: span 4`), and explicitly place elements. Grid Lanes automatically creates a \"waterfall\" layout when `grid-template-columns` is used, or a \"brick\" layout with `grid-template-rows`, thanks to a new default for `grid-auto-flow`. This system improves accessibility by maintaining a logical tabbing order and supports infinite scrolling layouts without JavaScript.\n\nA new concept, `item-tolerance` (default `1em`), governs how strictly the layout algorithm places items, preventing minor size differences from creating visually and logically jarring content reordering. This ensures a smoother user experience.\n\nCurrently available in Safari Technology Preview 234, Grid Lanes' core syntax is stable, though some property names like `item-tolerance` are still being finalized. Developers are encouraged to try it out, build demos, and provide feedback to the CSS Working Group.",
    "chinese_title": "CSS 网格轨道",
    "chinese_summary": "CSS Grid Lanes 于 2025 年 12 月 19 日推出，标志着网页布局的重大进步，特别是对于原生瀑布流（masonry-style）设计。经过多年的开发和讨论，它为动态内容排列提供了一个强大的解决方案。\n\n在实现时，开发者在容器上使用 `display: grid-lanes`。这些轨道则通过 `grid-template-columns` 或 `grid-template-rows` 来定义，充分利用 CSS Grid 的强大功能，实现灵活、响应式的布局。例如，`grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(250px, 1fr))` 可以创建填充可用空间的响应式列，无需媒体查询。\n\n主要特性包括创建不同大小的轨道、让项目跨越多个轨道 (`grid-column: span 4`)，以及显式定位元素的能力。当使用 `grid-template-columns` 时，Grid Lanes 会自动创建“瀑布流”布局；当使用 `grid-template-rows` 时，则创建“砖块”布局，这得益于 `grid-auto-flow` 的新默认值。该系统通过保持逻辑的 Tab 键顺序来提高可访问性，并支持无需 JavaScript 的无限滚动布局。\n\n一个新概念是 `item-tolerance`（默认 `1em`），它控制布局算法放置项目的严格程度，防止细微的尺寸差异导致视觉上和逻辑上令人不适的内容重排。这确保了更流畅的用户体验。\n\nGrid Lanes 目前已在 Safari Technology Preview 234 中可用，其核心语法已趋于稳定，尽管像 `item-tolerance` 这样的一些属性名称仍在最终确定中。鼓励开发者尝试使用它、构建演示，并向 CSS 工作组提供反馈。"

    "url": "https://pierce.dev/notes/go-ahead-self-host-postgres#user-content-fn-1",
    "summary": "The article challenges the dominant narrative from cloud providers that self-hosting databases, especially Postgres, is terrifying and dangerous. It argues that this \"database as a service\" (DaaS) model, which gained traction with Amazon RDS in 2009 and accelerated around 2015, has become overly expensive and often an \"undifferentiated heavy lifting\" abstraction rather than a magical solution.\n\nThe author explains that managed services mostly run slightly modified open-source Postgres with operational tooling. Their own experience running self-hosted Postgres for two years, serving millions of queries daily, has been fast, stable, and much cheaper, causing only 30 minutes of stress. Performance on self-hosted instances can even surpass DaaS due to greater tuning flexibility.\n\nOperational complexity is often exaggerated; routine monthly tasks like security updates and capacity planning are manageable. While self-hosting requires incident response, cloud outages also page users, often with fewer tools.\n\nSelf-hosting is recommended for most, with exceptions for absolute beginners, extremely large enterprises needing dedicated database engineers, or highly regulated workloads. Key configurations for self-hosting include:\n*   **Memory:** Tuning `shared_buffers`, `effective_cache_size`, `work_mem`, and `maintenance_work_mem`.\n*   **Connection Management:** Utilizing a connection pooler like PgBouncer for efficiency.\n*   **Storage:** Optimizing settings like `random_page_cost` for NVMe SSDs.\n*   **WAL:** Configuring `wal_level` and `max_wal_size` for durability.\n\nThe author concludes that self-hosting Postgres occupies a significant \"sweet spot\" for many teams, advocating for a hybrid infrastructure future where self-hosting is reconsidered, especially for those paying substantial monthly fees for DaaS.",
    "chinese_title": "尽管自托管Postgres",
    "chinese_summary": "这篇文章挑战了云服务提供商的主流叙事，即自托管数据库，尤其是Postgres，是可怕且危险的。文章认为，这种在2009年随Amazon RDS推出而受到关注并在2015年左右加速发展的“数据库即服务”（DaaS）模式，已经变得过于昂贵，并且往往是一种“无差别的繁重工作”抽象层，而非神奇的解决方案。\n\n作者解释说，托管服务大多运行的是略微修改过的开源Postgres，并配备了运维工具。作者自己运行自托管Postgres两年，每天处理数百万次查询的经验表明，它快速、稳定且便宜得多，仅造成了30分钟的压力。由于更大的调优灵活性，自托管实例的性能甚至可以超越DaaS。\n\n运维复杂性常被夸大；像安全更新和容量规划这样的常规月度任务是可管理的。尽管自托管需要事件响应，但云服务中断也会向用户发出警报，而且通常提供的工具更少。\n\n建议大多数人采用自托管，但绝对的初学者、需要专属数据库工程师的超大型企业或受高度监管的工作负载除外。自托管的关键配置包括：\n*   **内存：** 调整 `shared_buffers`、`effective_cache_size`、`work_mem` 和 `maintenance_work_mem`。\n*   **连接管理：** 利用 PgBouncer 等连接池工具提高效率。\n*   **存储：** 为NVMe SSD优化 `random_page_cost` 等设置。\n*   **WAL：** 配置 `wal_level` 和 `max_wal_size` 以确保持久性。\n\n作者总结道，自托管Postgres对许多团队来说占据了一个重要的“最佳位置”，并倡导一个混合基础设施的未来，在这种未来中，自托管应被重新考虑，尤其对于那些为DaaS支付高额月费的用户。"

The primary target is \"Have I Been Flocked?\" (HIBF), a website created to critically review Cyble's products and business practices, including past allegations of questionable data sourcing and inflated claims.\n\nAccording to the article, Cyble Inc., co-founded by Beenu Arora and Deepansh Singh, has repeatedly issued baseless DMCA notices against HIBF for fair use content, claiming copyright infringement on their own marketing materials used in critical commentary. More alarmingly, they are accused of sending fabricated abuse reports to HIBF's hosting providers and domain registrars, falsely alleging that HIBF is involved in cybercrime, such as distributing malware or phishing. One incident reportedly involved linking HIBF to a legitimate penetration testing tool hosted on an unrelated website, suggesting manufactured evidence to justify takedowns.\n\nThese actions have resulted in significant downtime for HIBF and forced multiple infrastructure relocations. The article characterizes this as a \"strategic litigation against public participation\" (SLAPP) tactic, warning that if such practices go unchecked, they set a dangerous precedent, allowing companies to silence legitimate criticism by falsely accusing critics of criminal activity.",
