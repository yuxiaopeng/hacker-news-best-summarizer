    "summary": "Flock Safety exposed livestreams and administrator control panels for at least 60 of its AI-enabled \"Condor\" surveillance cameras to the open internet. These pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) cameras, designed to record and track *people* rather than just vehicles, were accessible without any password or login. This allowed anyone to view real-time footage, download 30 days of video archives, and even change camera settings or run diagnostics.\n\nThe article's author verified this vulnerability by watching themselves on a livestream while standing in front of a camera in Bakersfield. Researchers observed Condor cameras automatically zooming in on individuals, including a woman walking her dog, a man in a parking lot, children on a playground, and a rollerblader tracked across multiple cameras with high resolution.\n\nYouTuber Benn Jordan and security researcher Jon “GainSec” Gaines initially discovered the exposure using the IoT search engine Shodan. Jordan expressed significant concern, especially regarding footage of unattended children on playgrounds, highlighting how trivially easy it would be to identify individuals from the exposed feeds. The incident underscores severe privacy risks when advanced surveillance technology lacks fundamental security.",

    "chinese_summary": "Flock Safety将其至少60个AI驱动的“秃鹰”（Condor）监控摄像头的实时视频流和管理员控制面板暴露在了公共互联网上。这些旨在记录和追踪“人”而非仅仅车辆的云台变焦（PTZ）摄像头，无需任何密码或登录即可访问。这使得任何人都可以查看实时影像、下载30天的视频存档，甚至更改摄像头设置或运行诊断程序。\n\n文章作者通过站在贝克斯菲尔德（Bakersfield）的一个摄像头前，并在实时视频流中看到自己，从而验证了这一漏洞。研究人员观察到，“秃鹰”摄像头会自动对个人进行变焦，包括一位遛狗的女士、停车场里的一名男子、游乐场上的儿童，以及一名被多个摄像头高分辨率追踪的溜旱冰者。\n\nYouTuber Benn Jordan和安全研究员Jon “GainSec” Gaines最初是利用物联网搜索引擎Shodan发现了这一暴露问题。Jordan表达了严重的担忧，特别是对游乐场上无人看管儿童的影像，他强调从暴露的视频流中识别个人是多么轻而易举。此次事件凸显了当先进监控技术缺乏基本安全保障时所带来的严重隐私风险。"

    "url": "https://www.aiforswes.com/p/you-dont-need-to-spend-100mo-on-claude",
    "summary": "This article, initially hypothesizing that upgrading hardware for local AI coding models could replace expensive cloud subscriptions, underwent a significant correction. While local models are \"far more capable than they’re given credit for, even for coding,\" and can handle roughly 90% of development tasks, the crucial \"last 10%\" for professional work often justifies the cost of frontier cloud models like Claude Code. The author clarified that the initial assessment overlooked the impact of other development tools (e.g., Docker) on RAM, which severely limits local model capability in production settings.\n\nNonetheless, local models are presented as \"incredible supplemental models\" that can reduce subscription costs. The article remains a valuable guide for setting up and understanding local coding AI. Key benefits include reliability (immune to provider-induced performance regressions), enhanced privacy for intellectual property, and availability (offline use). Technical considerations for setup involve understanding memory demands (model size, context window, quantization), choosing instruct models for chat, selecting serving tools like Ollama or MLX, and optimizing for time-to-first-token and tokens per second.",
    "chinese_title": "本地代码模型指南",
    "chinese_summary": "本文最初假设升级本地AI编码模型的硬件可以取代昂贵的云服务订阅，但这一观点经过了重大修正。尽管本地模型“能力远超预期，甚至在编码方面也是如此”，并且可以处理大约90%的开发任务，但对于专业工作而言，那至关重要的“最后10%”往往能证明Claude Code等前沿云模型的成本是合理的。作者澄清说，最初的评估忽略了其他开发工具（如Docker）对内存（RAM）的影响，这严重限制了本地模型在生产环境中的能力。\n\n尽管如此，本地模型仍被视为“极佳的辅助模型”，可以降低订阅成本。本文仍然是设置和理解本地编码AI的宝贵指南。主要优点包括可靠性（不受服务提供商导致的性能退步影响）、增强的知识产权隐私保护以及可用性（离线使用）。设置方面的技术考量包括理解内存需求（模型大小、上下文窗口、量化）、为聊天选择指令模型、选择Ollama或MLX等服务工具，以及优化首个令牌生成时间（time-to-first-token）和每秒令牌数（tokens per second）。"

    "summary": "The US Department of the Interior has abruptly halted all five offshore wind projects currently under construction, citing \"national security risks\" based on a classified Department of Defense report. This move by the \"second Trump administration\" follows numerous past attempts to impede offshore wind development, which were largely unsuccessful in court, with judges vacating executive orders and ruling against the government's arguments.\n\nThe decision affects projects like Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, Empire Wind, Revolution Wind (already 80% complete), Sunrise Wind, and Vineyard Wind 1 (nearing completion). The Interior Department vaguely referenced radar interference and \"rapid evolution of relevant adversary technologies\" but stated the DoD analysis is classified, making it difficult for the public and affected parties to understand the specific reasons or challenge the decision legally.\n\nStates, many of which rely on these projects for power, are expected to fiercely oppose the move. Connecticut's Attorney General called it a \"lawless and erratic stop work order\" aiming to circumvent prior court rulings and is evaluating legal options. Project developers, having invested heavily, are also poised to fight the decision. The article suggests this classified report is a new tactic to block wind power, differing from earlier failed efforts primarily by its increased resistance to legal scrutiny.",
    "chinese_title": "美国叫停所有海上风电建设，称原因保密。",
    "chinese_summary": "美国内政部突然叫停了目前正在建设中的所有五个海上风电项目，理由是基于一份机密的国防部报告，声称存在“国家安全风险”。“第二届特朗普政府”的这一举动，是在此前多次试图阻碍海上风电发展之后采取的，但这些努力在法庭上大多以失败告终，法官们撤销了行政命令并驳回了政府的论点。\n\n这一决定影响了诸如弗吉尼亚海岸海上风电项目、帝国风电项目、革命风电项目（已完成80%）、日出风电项目以及葡萄园风电1号项目（即将竣工）。内政部模糊地提到了雷达干扰和“相关敌对技术的快速发展”，但表示国防部的分析是机密的，这使得公众和受影响方难以理解具体原因或通过法律途径挑战这一决定。\n\n预计许多依赖这些项目供电的州将强烈反对这一举动。康涅狄格州总检察长称之为“非法且反复无常的停工令”，旨在规避此前的法院裁决，并正在评估法律选择。项目开发商投入巨资，也准备反击这一决定。文章指出，这份机密报告是一种阻止风力发电的新策略，与早期失败的努力不同之处主要在于其对法律审查的抵制性更强。"

    "summary": "The Transformer, introduced in the \"Attention is All You Need\" paper, is a deep learning model designed to improve machine translation speed and training parallelization. It consists of an encoder-decoder structure, with each component being a stack of identical sub-layers.\n\nEach encoder processes input sequences through a self-attention layer, which helps it weigh the importance of other words when encoding a specific word, followed by a position-wise feed-forward neural network. Decoders similarly use self-attention and feed-forward networks, adding an extra attention layer to focus on relevant parts of the encoder's output.\n\nInputs begin as word embeddings. Crucially, to account for word order, positional encoding vectors are added to these embeddings. Self-attention works by creating three vectors for each word: Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V). Attention scores are calculated by dot-producting Q with K, scaling, applying a softmax function, and then summing the weighted V vectors. This process allows the model to identify relevant contextual words.\n\nMulti-headed attention enhances this by performing the self-attention calculation multiple times with different learned Q/K/V weight matrices. This enables the model to focus on various parts of the input sequence simultaneously and learn diverse contextual representations. The outputs from these heads are then combined. This parallelizable architecture makes the Transformer highly efficient, distinguishing it from traditional sequential models. The concepts have evolved and are now covered in an updated book.",
