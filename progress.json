    "title": "ASCII characters are not pixels: a deep dive into ASCII rendering",
    "url": "https://alexharri.com/blog/ascii-rendering",
    "summary": "This article details an advanced approach to ASCII rendering that overcomes the common issue of blurry, jagged edges by leveraging the intrinsic shapes of ASCII characters rather than treating them as mere pixels. Traditional methods involve splitting an image into a grid and assigning characters based on the lightness of a single sample (nearest-neighbor) or an average of multiple samples (supersampling) within each cell. While supersampling reduces pixelation, it still results in blurriness because each grid cell is represented by a single, averaged lightness value, ignoring the character's internal structure.\n\nThe author's solution focuses on \"shape-based\" rendering. It quantifies the unique visual density distribution of each ASCII character (e.g., top-heavy, left-heavy) by defining multiple \"sampling circles\" within a character cell (initially, upper and lower). For each character, an \"overlap\" value with these circles forms a pre-calculated, normalized \"shape vector.\" During rendering, for each grid cell in the input image, a \"sampling vector\" is generated by averaging pixel lightness within its corresponding sampling circles. A nearest-neighbor search then matches this sampling vector to the most geometrically similar pre-calculated character shape vector.\n\nThis method allows characters to accurately follow contours, yielding dramatically sharper edges and a higher effective resolution compared to pixel-based approaches. The author also implemented a cel-shading like effect for enhanced contrast between colored regions. While the initial 2D shape vector (upper/lower circles) improves quality, the article notes its limitations in capturing all character shapes.",
    "chinese_title": "ASCII 字符不是像素：深入探讨 ASCII 渲染",
    "chinese_summary": "本文详细介绍了一种先进的ASCII渲染方法，它通过利用ASCII字符的内在形状而非将其视为简单的像素，克服了模糊和锯齿边缘的常见问题。传统方法涉及将图像分割成网格，并根据每个单元格内单个采样点（最近邻）或多个采样点（超采样）的亮度平均值来分配字符。尽管超采样减少了像素化，但它仍然会导致模糊，因为每个网格单元都由一个单一的、平均的亮度值表示，从而忽略了字符的内部结构。\n\n作者的解决方案侧重于“基于形状”的渲染。它通过在字符单元格内定义多个“采样圆”（最初是上方和下方）来量化每个ASCII字符独特的视觉密度分布（例如，顶部重、左侧重）。对于每个字符，其与这些圆的“重叠”值形成一个预先计算好的、归一化的“形状向量”。在渲染过程中，对于输入图像中的每个网格单元，通过计算其相应采样圆内像素亮度的平均值来生成一个“采样向量”。随后，通过最近邻搜索将此采样向量与几何上最相似的预计算字符形状向量进行匹配。\n\n这种方法使字符能够精确地遵循轮廓，与基于像素的方法相比，产生了显著更锐利的边缘和更高的有效分辨率。作者还实现了一种类似卡通渲染（cel-shading）的效果，以增强不同颜色区域之间的对比度。尽管最初的二维形状向量（上方/下方圆）提高了质量，但文章指出其在捕捉所有字符形状方面存在局限性。"

    "summary": "The article highlights an intriguing observation made by \"Héliographe\" on Mastodon: if one views Apple's iconic designs in reverse chronological order, it creates the illusion of someone progressively *losing* design skill, rather than improving. The title suggests that while the forward progression showcases a designer \"getting good\" and refining their work, reversing this sequence makes it appear as though the designs become less sophisticated or more rudimentary over time. The rest of the provided content consists of a technical note about enabling JavaScript for the Mastodon web application, which is unrelated to the design commentary itself.",

    "chinese_summary": "这篇文章强调了“Héliographe”在Mastodon上提出的一个有趣观察：如果人们倒序查看苹果的标志性设计，就会产生一种错觉，好像设计师的设计能力在逐渐 *退步*，而非进步。标题暗示，虽然正向顺序展示了设计师“精进”并完善其作品的过程，但颠倒这个顺序，则会让人觉得设计随着时间的推移变得不那么精致或更加简陋。所提供内容的其余部分是关于为Mastodon网络应用启用JavaScript的技术说明，这与设计评论本身无关。"

    "url": "https://www.caimito.net/en/blog/2025/12/07/the-recurring-dream-of-replacing-developers.html",
    "summary": "Since 1969, every decade has brought a recurring dream: to simplify software development enough to replace or significantly reduce the need for specialized developers. From COBOL and CASE tools to Visual Basic, low-code platforms, and now AI, each technological wave promised to democratize software creation, yet the demand for professional developers has only grown.\n\nThe article highlights that this pattern persists because the perceived simplicity of high-level requirements belies the immense underlying complexity of software. Handling details, edge cases, and system interactions requires deep intellectual reasoning that no tool or language can eliminate. COBOL couldn't enable business users to program, CASE tools struggled with complex code generation, and Visual Basic, while expanding access, still required expertise for robust systems.\n\nToday's AI coding assistants represent significant progress, genuinely assisting developers and amplifying their capabilities. However, they do not replace the human judgment necessary to understand business problems, evaluate generated code, ensure security, manage integration, and maintain systems as requirements evolve. AI changes *how* developers work, not *if* they are needed.\n\nThe paradox is that despite advanced tools, the demand for software far exceeds our ability to create it, fueling the dream of faster, more accessible development. The core constraint isn't mechanical (typing speed or syntax) but intellectual—the thinking required to manage complexity. Leaders should assess new tools based on whether they empower developers to work more effectively on complex problems, accelerate specific solutions, and reduce repetitive tasks, rather than expecting them to eliminate the need for human expertise. The pursuit of this dream, while never fully realized, consistently yields valuable tools that improve development processes and expand who can participate in software creation.",
    "chinese_title": "取代开发者的反复梦想",
    "chinese_summary": "自1969年以来，每个十年都带来了一个反复出现的梦想：充分简化软件开发，以取代或显著减少对专业开发人员的需求。从COBOL和CASE工具到Visual Basic、低代码平台，再到如今的AI，每一波技术浪潮都承诺将软件创作大众化，然而对专业开发人员的需求却有增无减。\n\n文章强调，这种模式之所以持续存在，是因为高级需求表面上的简单性掩盖了软件背后巨大的内在复杂性。处理细节、边缘情况和系统交互需要深度的智力推理，这是任何工具或语言都无法消除的。COBOL未能使业务用户能够编程，CASE工具在复杂代码生成方面举步维艰，而Visual Basic虽然拓宽了访问范围，但构建健壮的系统仍需要专业知识。\n\n当今的AI编码助手代表了重大进展，它们真正帮助开发人员并增强了他们的能力。然而，它们无法取代人类在理解业务问题、评估生成代码、确保安全、管理集成以及在需求演变时维护系统方面所需的判断力。AI改变了开发人员的*工作方式*，而不是*是否需要*他们。\n\n悖论在于，尽管有先进的工具，但软件需求远远超过我们创建它的能力，这进一步推动了更快、更易于开发的梦想。核心制约因素不是机械性的（打字速度或语法），而是智力性的——管理复杂性所需的思考。领导者应评估新工具是否能赋予开发人员更有效地处理复杂问题、加速特定解决方案和减少重复性任务的能力，而不是期望它们能消除对人类专业知识的需求。对这一梦想的追求，尽管从未完全实现，但始终能产生有价值的工具，从而改进开发流程并扩大参与软件创建的人群。"

    "title": "Predicting OpenAI's ad strategy",
    "url": "https://ossa-ma.github.io/blog/openads",
    "summary": "The author refutes claims of OpenAI's financial instability, citing its $40B funding, projected $20B ARR for 2025, and massive user base (190M DAU), arguing it's on track for a $1T IPO, not collapse. Despite an $8-12B annual burn rate, the author predicts OpenAI's ad strategy will be pivotal.\n\nOpenAI plans to introduce ads in ChatGPT's free and Go tiers, starting Q1 2026. Ads will appear at the bottom of relevant answers, expanding to search, sidebar content, and affiliate features by 2027. Principles include answer independence, user privacy, and control, with paid tiers remaining ad-free. The company reportedly targets $1B in ad revenue for 2026, escalating to $25B by 2029, via a self-serve platform and transactional commissions.\n\nComparing ChatGPT to existing ad platforms, the author argues its high-intent queries are comparable to Google Search. Annual Revenue Per User (ARPU) is projected to grow from a \"Perplexity Floor\" of $5.50 in 2026 to $50.00 by 2029, envisioning \"Conversational Commerce.\"\n\nWith conservative user growth estimates due to competition, total projected revenue (including subscriptions, API, enterprise, and ads) is estimated to reach $30-35B in 2026 and a staggering $140-150B by 2029. The hiring of ex-Meta ad leader Fidji Simo as \"CEO of Applications\" reinforces this strategic pivot. The author cynically concludes that \"the A in AGI stands for Ads,\" viewing advertising as a \"necessary evil\" to fund the mission of AGI.",
    "chinese_title": "预测OpenAI的广告策略",
    "chinese_summary": "作者反驳了关于OpenAI财务不稳定的说法，引用了其400亿美元的资金、预计2025年达到200亿美元的年度经常性收入（ARR），以及庞大的用户基础（1.9亿日活跃用户），认为它正朝着1万亿美元的首次公开募股（IPO）迈进，而非走向崩溃。尽管每年烧钱80-120亿美元，作者预测OpenAI的广告策略将是关键。\n\nOpenAI计划从2026年第一季度开始，在ChatGPT的免费版和Go版中引入广告。广告将出现在相关答案的底部，并计划在2027年扩展到搜索、侧边栏内容和联盟营销功能。其原则包括答案独立性、用户隐私和控制，而付费层级将保持无广告。据报道，该公司目标是2026年广告收入达到10亿美元，并通过自助服务平台和交易佣金，到2029年增至250亿美元。\n\n将ChatGPT与现有广告平台进行比较，作者认为其高意图查询与谷歌搜索具有可比性。预计每用户平均收入（ARPU）将从2026年的“Perplexity下限”5.50美元增长到2029年的50.00美元，设想实现“对话式商务”。\n\n考虑到竞争导致的保守用户增长估算，预计总收入（包括订阅、API、企业和广告）将在2026年达到300-350亿美元，并在2029年达到惊人的1400-1500亿美元。聘请前Meta广告主管Fidji Simo担任“应用程序首席执行官”进一步证实了这一战略转向。作者略带嘲讽地总结道，“通用人工智能（AGI）中的A代表广告（Ads）”，将广告视为资助通用人工智能使命的“必要之恶”。"
