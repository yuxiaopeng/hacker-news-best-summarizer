    "summary": "French International Criminal Court (ICC) judge Nicolas Guillou has been sanctioned by the United States under a decision made by Donald Trump on August 20. The US Treasury Department justified the action, stating that Guillou was designated for his role in authorizing the ICC's issuance of arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant. Both Israeli officials are indicted for war crimes and crimes against humanity for their roles in the destruction of the Gaza Strip.\n\nGuillou is one of nine ICC personnel sanctioned by the US, a group that includes six judges and three prosecutors, notably Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan. In an interview with Le Monde, Guillou described the impact of these measures on his work and daily life and called on European authorities to activate a mechanism to limit the effects of US restrictions. The US sanctions mechanism, initially designed for human rights violations, counter-terrorism, and drug trafficking, now lists nearly 15,000 individuals, predominantly members of terrorist groups, mafia organizations, and authoritarian regimes, with ICC judges recently added to this extensive list.",

    "url": "https://codemanship.wordpress.com/2025/11/25/the-future-of-software-development-is-software-developers/",
    "summary": "A 43-year veteran programmer, the author dismisses the notion that Large Language Models (LLMs) will replace software developers, viewing it as the latest iteration in a long cycle of similar, failed predictions. He recounts previous technologies—from WYSIWYG editors and 4GLs to No-Code platforms—that were similarly touted as the \"end of programmers,\" yet consistently resulted in more programs and more developers, illustrating Jevons Paradox.\n\nWhile acknowledging the unprecedented scale of current \"AI\" hype, the author argues that LLMs often hinder development, making software less reliable and maintainable, unlike previous genuinely productive tools. The fundamental challenge of programming, he explains, isn't syntax but transforming ambiguous human thought into precise, unambiguous computational logic—a task requiring general intelligence that LLMs, with their syntactic models, fundamentally lack. He emphasizes that LLM-generated code is inconsistent, prone to errors, and demands human expertise for recognition and correction.\n\nSkeptical about the long-term viability of expensive hyper-scale LLMs, he likens them to unsustainable \"Apollo Moon missions.\" The author foresees a future where modest \"AI\" assistants might aid with prototypes or minor tasks, but human software developers will remain indispensable at the helm, likely in greater numbers. He advises employers to hire developers now, predicting a resurgence in demand once the current \"fever dream\" of AI replacing programmers dissipates.",

    "chinese_summary": "拥有43年经验的资深程序员兼本文作者驳斥了大型语言模型（LLMs）将取代软件开发人员的观点，认为这只是漫长且失败的同类预测循环中的最新一环。他回顾了从所见即所得编辑器、第四代编程语言（4GLs）到无代码平台等之前的技术，它们曾被同样吹捧为“程序员的终结”，但结果却始终是带来了更多的程序和更多的开发人员，这恰好印证了杰文斯悖论。\n\n尽管作者承认当前“AI”炒作的规模前所未有，但他认为，与之前真正提高生产力的工具不同，LLMs往往阻碍开发，使软件变得更不可靠、更难以维护。他解释说，编程的根本挑战不在于语法，而在于将模糊的人类思维转化为精确、无歧义的计算逻辑——这项任务需要通用智能，而LLMs凭借其句法模型根本不具备这种能力。他强调，LLM生成的代码前后不一致，容易出错，需要人类专业知识来识别和纠正。\n\n他对昂贵的超大规模LLMs的长期可行性持怀疑态度，将它们比作不可持续的“阿波罗登月任务”。作者预见未来，适度的“AI”助手或许能协助原型开发或次要任务，但人类软件开发人员仍将不可或缺地掌控全局，甚至数量可能还会增加。他建议雇主现在就招聘开发人员，预测一旦当前AI取代程序员的“狂热梦想”消散，对开发人员的需求将重新激增。"
