This feature allows AI agents to run in the background within a separate, contained Windows session, complete with their own runtime, desktop, and user account.\n\nCrucially, these AI agents will have read and write access to \"Known folders\" like Desktop, Music, Pictures, Videos, Documents, and Downloads. The agents are designed to mimic human interaction, navigating interfaces and performing tasks on the user's behalf (e.g., booking a trip). Unlike Windows Sandbox, which offers complete isolation without file access, Agent Workspace explicitly bridges this gap to allow agents to interact with personal data.\n\nWhile Microsoft insists on security isolation, user control, and transparency, the company acknowledges potential risks. The feature is optional, accessed via a toggle in Settings' \"AI Components,\" and currently available only to Windows Insiders. Performance warnings exist due to agents running continuously, though Microsoft suggests limited resource consumption.\n\nThis move has faced considerable criticism from the user community, leading to a backlash against Microsoft's leadership.

For nine years, Rebble has maintained the Pebble smartwatch ecosystem after Pebble Technology Corporation ceased operations, investing hundreds of thousands of dollars and extensive effort into salvaging data, building a functional App Store, and developing new services like Bobby. They state that Core Devices' current Pebble App Store is entirely built upon Rebble's decade-long work.\n\nRebble claims that Core Devices demanded unrestricted access to all their work, misrepresented the origin of essential components in Eric's newsletter, and, despite verbal assurances, refused to legally commit to not creating a proprietary \"walled garden\" app store that would replace Rebble. Furthermore, Core allegedly scraped Rebble's app store data in violation of a previous agreement. Rebble also points out that Core used Rebble-funded development for PebbleOS and libpebblecommon as a base for their commercial products, often under more restrictive terms, without merging contributions back into the open-source community.\n\nRebble's main concern is preventing Core from taking their community's hard-earned work to build a closed-source ecosystem, potentially leaving users with nothing if Core's ventures fail or are acquired. Rebble proposes two difficult options to its community: legally protect their work or allow Core to use it unrestricted.

    "summary": "Quake, released in 1996, faced the challenge of an OS shift from MS-DOS to Windows 95. id Software opted for a single `quake.exe` binary, compiled with DJGPP and using a DPMI extender, designed to run on both DOS and Windows 95's DPMI server.\n\nUnder pure DOS, multiplayer was limited to modem, NullModem, or IPX via a TSR; native TCP/IP was practically non-existent for gamers. While `quake.exe` could run in a Windows 95 DOS box, it initially offered the same limited networking options.\n\nTo enable TCP/IP multiplayer on Windows 95, id Software partnered with Mpath Interactive, an online gaming service. Mpath provided a proprietary technology dubbed the \"Chunnel,\" activated by `q95.bat`. This script launched `qlaunch.exe`, which loaded `quakeudp.dll`. This DLL acted as the bridge to Windows 95's native Winsock (`wsock32.dll`).\n\nThe ingenious core of the Chunnel involved `genvxd.dll` loading a Virtual Device Driver (`GENVXD.VXD`). This VxD installed itself to respond to a software interrupt (0x48). On Quake's side, Mpath supplied `mpplc.c`, an implementation of the BSD socket API. When `quake.exe` made a socket call, `mpplc.c` marshaled the data, and the DPMI client triggered interrupt 0x48. The `GENVXD.VXD` then unmarshaled this data and routed it to `wsock32.dll`, effectively giving the DOS executable access to Windows 95's TCP/IP stack.\n\nThis complex system became obsolete after December 1996, when id Software transitioned to native Win32 executables like `winquake.exe`, which could directly access `wsock32.dll`.",

    "summary": "On November 18, 2025, Cloudflare experienced a major outage from 11:20 UTC, with core services largely restored by 14:30 UTC and full recovery by 17:06 UTC. The incident was not a cyberattack but stemmed from a permissions change in a ClickHouse database. This change caused a query, used by the Bot Management system, to return duplicate entries, effectively doubling the size of its critical \"feature configuration file\" beyond an internal software limit of 200 features.\n\nWhen this oversized, corrupted file propagated across Cloudflare's network, the core proxy software panicked, leading to widespread HTTP 5xx errors. The fluctuating nature of the errors (due to the file being regenerated every five minutes, sometimes correctly, sometimes with bad data) initially led engineers to suspect a DDoS attack, a belief further complicated by an unrelated outage of Cloudflare's status page.\n\nThe outage impacted core CDN and security services, Turnstile, Workers KV, the Cloudflare Dashboard (affecting logins), and Cloudflare Access (causing authentication failures). Resolution involved stopping the propagation of the faulty file, manually inserting a known good version, and restarting the core proxy. Cloudflare is implementing hardening measures for configuration file ingestion, enabling more global kill switches, and improving error handling to prevent future occurrences.",

    "chinese_summary": "2025年11月18日，Cloudflare从世界标准时间11:20开始经历了一次重大中断，核心服务到14:30基本恢复，并于17:06完全恢复。此次事件并非网络攻击，而是源于ClickHouse数据库中的一次权限更改。这次更改导致Bot管理系统使用的一个查询返回了重复条目，使其关键的“功能配置文件”大小翻倍，超出了内部软件200项功能的限制。\n\n当这个过大且损坏的文件在Cloudflare网络中传播时，核心代理软件崩溃，导致HTTP 5xx错误大范围出现。错误的波动性（因为文件每五分钟重新生成一次，有时正确，有时包含错误数据）最初导致工程师怀疑是DDoS攻击，而Cloudflare状态页面的另一次不相关中断使情况进一步复杂化。\n\n此次中断影响了核心CDN和安全服务、Turnstile、Workers KV、Cloudflare Dashboard（影响登录）以及Cloudflare Access（导致认证失败）。解决方案包括停止故障文件的传播、手动插入已知良好版本并重启核心代理。Cloudflare正在实施配置文件的摄取强化措施，启用更多全球范围的紧急停止开关，并改进错误处理，以防止未来发生此类事件。"

    "summary": "The article argues against using Cloudflare for websites unless absolutely necessary, primarily because it creates a single point of failure. Citing a recent outage on November 18th that took down numerous sites, including small ones, the author highlights the risk of relying on a centralized service.\n\nThe author contends that many small sites are \"scared\" into believing they need DDoS protection, which is largely unnecessary. For a small blog with minimal visitors, the likelihood of being targeted by significant DDoS attacks is extremely low, much like the idea that \"no one will burn their DDoS capabilities on you!\"\n\nThe piece also points out the contradiction of advocating for a decentralized web while simultaneously using Cloudflare. As an alternative for sites genuinely concerned about server downtime, the author suggests implementing a second server location and utilizing round-robin DNS with A and AAAA records for redundancy. The core message encourages site owners to put their services directly on the internet, facing the minimal risks themselves rather than outsourcing potential outages to a third-party like Cloudflare.",

They argue Google's refusal to fix the XSLT library or transparently integrate a JavaScript \"polyfill\" demonstrates an intent to sabotage XML-based formats like RSS, offloading work onto developers for corporate control and profit. This mirrors Mozilla's past removal of \"Live Bookmarks.\"\n\nThe core message is \"Do Not Comply.\" The author urges developers to reject the polyfill, avoid changing XML files, and instead report XSLT's absence as a browser bug, demanding native support. Citing past successes with MathML and SMIL, they advocate for continued and increased use of XSLT, believing collective resistance can force Google to reinstate it. They assert Google's actions are political, part of a \"trillion-dollar ad company's\" broader scheme to control the web, with Apple and Mozilla also complicit in this \"enshittification.\"\n\nThe article also criticizes the WHATWG as a corporate-controlled entity, not a steward of the open web, pushing a vision of the web as a profit-driven \"application delivery platform.\" This necessitates a \"new browser war\" between users and corporations to reclaim control. The author laments the lack of truly independent browsers, with Firefox forks like Pale Moon offering limited hope despite current shortcomings.",

When this count reaches a specific threshold (e.g., 30 for small programs, 120 for larger ones), YJIT compiles that section of YARV instructions into machine language.\n\nThis machine code is stored in \"YJIT blocks,\" which are sequences of machine language instructions corresponding to a range of YARV instructions, typically smaller than an entire Ruby function or block. For instance, `getlocal_WC_1` and `getlocal_WC_0` YARV instructions are translated into ARM64 `mov` instructions.\n\nA challenge arises when YJIT encounters type-dependent operations, like `opt_plus`, where the specific machine language instructions depend on the data types being added (e.g., integers, floats, strings). To address this without upfront program analysis, YJIT employs \"branch stubs.\" Instead of compiling immediately, it creates a stub and observes the actual data types passed during runtime, allowing it to generate optimized, type-specific machine code later.",

The author highlights the need for search on their static blog and outlines the core components and steps involved.\n\nThe fundamental idea is to generate an index of the blog's content and then use client-side JavaScript to query this index. The process involves:\n\n1.  **Crawling:** Using `fs` and `gray-matter` in Node.js to read all markdown files, extract front matter (like title, tags), and the main content.\n2.  **Indexing:** Creating an array of JavaScript objects, where each object represents a post with an ID, URL, title, tags, and content. The content is tokenized and stored as an array of lowercase words to facilitate searching. This index is then minified and saved as a JSON file.\n3.  **Search Logic:** On the client-side, a simple JavaScript function loads this JSON index. When a user types a query, the function iterates through the indexed posts. For each post, it checks if any of the query terms (tokenized) are present in the post's tokenized content or tags. Results are ranked based on the number of matching terms and displayed to the user.\n\nThe article emphasizes simplicity, using standard JavaScript features and a basic matching algorithm for relevance. It serves as a good blueprint for implementing client-side search on static websites where server-side search is impractical or undesirable.",

This foundation underpins its \"smart pointer\" implementations:\n*   `UniquePtr` for automatic memory deallocation of single-owned resources.\n*   `SharedPtr` for automated, thread-safe reference counting of shared resources.\n\nFor dynamic data structures, `safe_c.h` offers:\n*   Type-safe `Vector` types that automatically handle allocation and growth, eliminating manual `realloc` complexities.\n*   Zero-cost `StringView` and `Span` for non-owning references to data slices, preventing needless allocations and copies.\n\nError handling is improved with Rust-inspired `Result` types, forcing explicit error management over `goto cleanup;` chains. Furthermore, `requires()` and `ensures()` macros provide self-documenting function contracts, while `safe_strcpy()` and similar functions offer bounds-checked string operations to prevent buffer overflows, addressing security vulnerabilities.\n\nThe author demonstrates these features through a high-performance `grep` clone (`cgrep`), asserting that `safe_c.h` gives C developers the \"freedom\" to write powerful, safe code by taming its inherent \"footguns\" with modern tools and clever abstraction.",

    "summary": "The article \"Are you stuck in movie logic?\" by Useful Fictions argues that our understanding of personal growth and problem-solving is often distorted by simplistic cinematic narratives. Movies condense complex real-world processes into short, linear stories with immediate resolutions, creating a \"movie logic\" that we unconsciously apply to our own lives.\n\nThis leads to frustration when reality, unlike films, is messy, slow, and non-linear. For example, movies depict characters instantly finding their passion or purpose, while in reality, it involves years of experimentation and failure. Similarly, filmic problems are often solved with a single dramatic confrontation, whereas real-world issues demand continuous effort, multiple attempts, and small, iterative adjustments. Personal transformation in movies occurs with a sudden \"aha!\" moment, but genuine growth is incremental and often imperceptible day-to-day.\n\nThe author warns that adhering to movie logic fosters impatience, discouragement, and a tendency to give up too soon when quick breakthroughs don't materialize. To overcome this, the article advocates embracing \"real-world logic\": accepting slow, cumulative growth; being open to experimentation and iteration; focusing on small, consistent actions; and acknowledging life's inherent uncertainty and complexity. The key is to shift perspective from expecting a cinematic climax to appreciating the ongoing, evolving nature of real life.",

    "summary": "Since Oracle announced its \"astonishing\" $300bn deal with OpenAI on September 10, its stock has shed $315bn in market value, despite similar performance from peers. This decline signals investor unease, as Oracle is making a substantial debt-financed bet on OpenAI, effectively becoming its public market proxy.\n\nOracle positions itself as uniquely able to scale OpenAI's compute capacity, promising lowest upfront costs as a data centre tenant. However, this strategy comes with significant financial risks. Oracle aims for $166bn in cloud revenue by 2030, with the majority expected from OpenAI by 2027. Achieving this requires massive capital expenditure, projected to reach $80bn annually by 2029.\n\nFinancially, Oracle's net debt is already 2.5 times EBITDA and is forecast to nearly double again by 2030, with cash flow projected to remain negative for five consecutive years. These factors have driven the cost of hedging Oracle debt to a three-year high.\n\nThe article also notes a broader shift: while OpenAI deals previously boosted share prices, recent announcements with Oracle, Broadcom, and Amazon have failed to provide a lift, and Nvidia's stock remained flat. This suggests waning investor enthusiasm for such partnerships, questioning the point of these massive commitments without a positive market reaction, especially given the risks of unfunded expansion.",

A meta-analysis of over 230 studies, published in *Nature Human Behaviour*, found that adapting goals in response to stress or challenges is often a more appropriate and beneficial response than relentless grinding.\n\nResearchers discovered that continuously pursuing impossible goals leads to increased stress, poorer well-being, and even physical health problems. In contrast, letting go of unachievable goals and *critically* re-engaging with new ones helps restore purpose and overall well-being. Factors influencing goal disengagement include negative feedback and \"action crises,\" while personality traits like optimism can foster goal revision. The study suggests that \"goal-striving flexibility\" is linked to feelings of security, stable regulation, and emotional resilience.\n\nThe analysis highlighted significant positive impacts: giving up on goals was linked to reduced stress, anxiety, and depression. Adopting new goals was strongly associated with improved social and physical functioning, psychological well-being, a sense of purpose, satisfaction, and personal growth.

    "summary": "ESPectre is an experimental motion detection system that uses Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) analysis to detect movement without cameras or microphones, prioritizing privacy.\n\nThe system leverages an ESP32-S3 device (~€10 hardware) to \"listen\" to Wi-Fi signal disturbances caused by movement. Unlike simple RSSI, CSI provides rich multi-dimensional data (amplitude, phase per subcarrier) that changes when a person moves, even through walls. It employs a mathematical approach, extracting 10 statistical, spatial, and temporal features from CSI data, thus requiring no initial Machine Learning training.\n\nSetup takes about 30-45 minutes and requires basic command-line knowledge for ESP-IDF firmware flashing. Software requirements include an MQTT broker (Home Assistant with built-in broker or standalone Mosquitto) and ESP-IDF v6.1. No router configuration is needed.\n\nKey advantages include total privacy (no cameras/mics), no wearables, low cost, and ability to detect movement through walls. Practical applications span home security, elderly care, smart automation, and energy saving. Optimal sensor placement is 3-8 meters from the router.\n\nThe ESPectre architecture involves CSI acquisition, Moving Variance Segmentation (MVS) to distinguish between IDLE and MOTION states, optional signal processing filters, feature extraction, and MQTT publishing to a broker, enabling seamless integration with Home Assistant for automations.\n\nWhile the system is a 2-state model (IDLE/MOTION) and doesn't distinguish between people and pets without further ML, it offers reliable detection with proper tuning.

    "url": "https://authress.io/knowledge-base/articles/2025/11/01/how-we-prevent-aws-downtime-impacts",
    "summary": "The article describes how Authress, an authentication and authorization platform, maintained uptime during a massive AWS us-east-1 outage, despite running some critical infrastructure in that region due to customer needs. Authress aims for an \"extraordinary\" five nines (99.999%) SLA, equating to just 5 minutes and 15 seconds of downtime per year. This is crucial because Authress is on its customers' critical path; if Authress is down, customer applications are down.\n\nThe author highlights that AWS's own service SLAs (e.g., Lambda, API Gateway) are below five nines, meaning relying solely on AWS components is insufficient for Authress's reliability goals. The article then delves into the mathematics of reliability, explaining that total uptime is the product of individual component success probabilities. Retries can significantly improve the perceived reliability of an unreliable third-party component. For instance, a component with 90% reliability would need 5 retries to achieve 99.999% success.\n\nHowever, the author introduces a critical nuance: the retry handler itself is a component with its own reliability. If a retry handler is 99.9995% reliable, it can only execute a maximum of two retries before its own unreliability begins to violate the overall five nines SLA. This creates a dilemma: if `RetriesRequired` (5) exceeds `RetriesAllowed` (2) by the handler, simply retrying isn't enough. The underlying third-party component must have a minimum reliability greater than 99.7% to be usable with such a retry mechanism. The article sets the stage for a deeper dive into Authress's actual architecture beyond basic retries to overcome these challenges.",

    "chinese_summary": "本文描述了Authress（一个身份验证和授权平台）在一次大规模的AWS us-east-1区域中断期间如何保持正常运行，尽管由于客户需求，它在该区域运行着一些关键基础设施。Authress的目标是达到“卓越的”五个九（99.999%）SLA，相当于每年仅有5分15秒的停机时间。这至关重要，因为Authress处于其客户的关键路径上；如果Authress停机，客户应用程序也会随之停机。\n\n作者指出，AWS自身的服务SLA（例如Lambda、API Gateway）低于五个九，这意味着仅依靠AWS组件不足以达到Authress的可靠性目标。文章随后深入探讨了可靠性数学原理，解释说总正常运行时间是各个组件成功概率的乘积。重试可以显著提高一个不可靠的第三方组件的感知可靠性。例如，一个可靠性为90%的组件需要5次重试才能达到99.999%的成功率。\n\n然而，作者提出了一个关键的细微差别：重试处理程序本身就是一个具有自身可靠性的组件。如果一个重试处理程序有99.9995%的可靠性，它最多只能执行两次重试，否则其自身的不可靠性就会开始违反整体的五个九SLA。这就产生了一个困境：如果所需的重试次数（5次）超过了处理程序所允许的重试次数（2次），仅仅重试是不够的。底层第三方组件必须具有高于99.7%的最低可靠性，才能与这种重试机制配合使用。这篇文章为更深入地探讨Authress超越基本重试机制的实际架构奠定了基础，以期克服这些挑战。"

    "summary": "The article asserts that geothermal energy, long underestimated, is finally ready for widespread adoption, driven by its reliability, low carbon footprint, and economic potential. Iceland exemplifies this shift, having transitioned to nearly 100% renewable energy, predominantly geothermal and hydropower, after the 1973 oil crisis. Geothermal power heats homes, melts snow, and provides over a quarter of the country's electricity.\n\nGeothermal energy works by tapping into Earth's internal heat; shallow wells provide direct heating, while deeper ones produce high-temperature steam for electricity generation. It's carbon-free, constant, and has a small environmental footprint. Iceland's pioneering Deep Drilling Project (IDDP) accidentally hit magma, creating the world's hottest and most powerful geothermal well, offering significantly higher energy output, despite subsequent operational challenges.\n\nHistorically, high upfront costs and the perception of geothermal being limited to volcanic regions hindered its development outside places like Kenya or New Zealand. However, this is rapidly changing. Over the past five years, North America has seen more than $1.5 billion in geothermal investments. Major tech companies, including Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon, are now contracting for geothermal energy to power their facilities, appreciating its grid independence. Crucially, geothermal now benefits from tax credits and fast-track permitting, enjoying bipartisan political support in the U.S.\n\nForgotten research from the 1970s U.S. government projects, which explored \"hot dry rock\" geothermal systems, is being revisited. Experts highlight that leveraging this past knowledge is vital for current advancements. The article concludes that geothermal energy, now overcoming its niche perception and historical barriers, represents a cost-competitive and sustainable solution with vast, untapped potential to meet global energy demands.",

    "url": "https://blog.cloudflare.com/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-fish-how-to-escape-the-linux-networking-stack/",
    "summary": "Cloudflare's \"soft-unicast\" system allows sharing IP addresses across machines, requiring precise control over IP/port combinations for both local TCP sockets and forwarded packets via TUN devices. This often clashes with the Linux networking stack's default behaviors.\n\nInitially, `iptables` SNAT rules proved too complex to manage at scale, leading to the development of a dedicated service, SLATFATF (fish). A core problem emerged: Netfilter's conntrack module would silently rewrite source ports of TCP sockets to avoid 5-tuple collisions, potentially assigning ports outside the designated soft-unicast range, breaking connections.\n\nSolutions attempted included:\n1.  Terminating TCP connections and proxying, which added latency and resource usage.\n2.  Using the Netlink interface to pre-create conntrack entries, but this was inefficient, fragile, and required manual timeout management.\n3.  Abusing `TCP_FASTOPEN_CONNECT` and `TCP_FASTOPEN_NO_COOKIE` to create \"connected\" sockets without a handshake. This effectively reserved 5-tuples, preventing conntrack from rewriting ports and ensuring other processes couldn't bind to the same address.\n\nThis \"connected socket\" approach created a new problem: Linux's `lookup local` routing rule (priority 0) would intercept packets for local addresses, preventing them from being forwarded to the TUN device. Routing rule manipulation was attempted (using `fwmark` and reordering `ip rule` entries, assigning IPs to loopback) to route marked packets to the TUN device.\n\nHowever, even with routing rule adjustments, packets still disappeared. The culprit was \"early demux,\" a Linux kernel feature (added in 2012) that bypasses routing lookups if a local socket is found early in the packet processing path. Since the \"connected\" socket existed, packets were treated as input and dropped, not forwarded.\n\nThe current workaround is to disable `net.ipv4.tcp_early_demux`, although its performance impact on Cloudflare's workloads needs evaluation, as the feature was intended for performance improvement.",
    "chinese_title": "如何跳出Linux网络栈",
    "chinese_summary": "Cloudflare的“软单播”系统允许在多台机器间共享IP地址，这要求对本地TCP套接字以及通过TUN设备转发的数据包的IP/端口组合进行精确控制。这通常与Linux网络协议栈的默认行为相冲突。\n\n最初，`iptables`的SNAT规则在大规模部署时管理过于复杂，导致开发了一个专用服务SLATFATF (fish)。一个核心问题浮现：Netfilter的conntrack模块会悄悄地重写TCP套接字的源端口以避免五元组冲突，这可能导致分配的端口超出指定的软单播范围，从而中断连接。\n\n尝试的解决方案包括：\n1.  终止TCP连接并进行代理，但这增加了延迟和资源开销。\n2.  使用Netlink接口预创建conntrack条目，但这效率低下、脆弱，并需要手动管理超时。\n3.  滥用`TCP_FASTOPEN_CONNECT`和`TCP_FASTOPEN_NO_COOKIE`来创建不带握手的“已连接”套接字。这有效地预留了五元组，阻止conntrack重写端口，并确保其他进程无法绑定到同一地址。\n\n这种“已连接套接字”方法带来了一个新问题：Linux的`lookup local`路由规则（优先级0）会拦截发往本地地址的数据包，阻止它们转发到TUN设备。为此尝试了路由规则操作（使用`fwmark`和重新排序`ip rule`条目，将IP分配给环回接口），以期将标记的数据包路由到TUN设备。\n\n然而，即使调整了路由规则，数据包仍然神秘消失。罪魁祸首是“early demux”（早期解复用），这是Linux内核的一个功能（2012年添加），它会在数据包处理路径的早期发现本地套接字时绕过路由查找。由于“已连接”套接字存在，数据包被视为本地输入并被丢弃，而不是被转发。\n\n当前的权宜之计是禁用`net.ipv4.tcp_early_demux`，尽管其对Cloudflare工作负载的性能影响需要评估，因为该功能最初是为了提升性能而设计的。"

    "summary": "The article explores the powerful impact of complementary currencies through historical examples, beginning with the \"Miracle of Wörgl\" during the 1932 Great Depression in Austria. Mayor Michael Unterguggenberger introduced \"stamp scrip\" to combat 30% unemployment. Backed by town funds, this local currency rapidly circulated, reducing unemployment to near zero within 13 months, funding infrastructure, and boosting revenues. Its success led to replication in neighboring villages and interest from 170 towns. However, the central bank banned complementary currencies, returning Wörgl to high unemployment and contributing to wider social unrest in Austria.\n\nInfluential US economist Irving Fisher advocated for similar \"stamp scrip\" to end the American Depression. Despite expert endorsement, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, fearing decentralization, prohibited all \"emergency currencies\" by executive decree, thereby prolonging the economic crisis.\n\nThe article also details a 250-year period (1040-1290) in the Central Middle Ages where widespread local currencies profoundly impacted Western Europe. Communities printed their own money to fund colossal projects like over 1,000 cathedrals and 350,000 churches. This community-driven financing created full employment, stimulated local economies, and fostered significant advancements. These structures, still generating economic returns through tourism, exemplify the long-term benefits. Complementary currencies, including modern cryptocurrencies, are now legal in most countries.",

This paper introduces MAKER, a novel system that successfully solves a task involving over one million LLM steps with zero errors, demonstrating scalability far beyond this benchmark.\n\nMAKER's success stems from two core principles: extreme task decomposition and robust error correction. It breaks down complex tasks into numerous focused subtasks, each handled by specialized microagents. This high level of modularity enables error correction to be applied at every single step through an efficient multi-agent voting scheme. This combined approach makes long-range, error-free execution possible.\n\nThe authors propose that instead of solely relying on incremental improvements to individual LLMs, massively decomposed agentic processes (MDAPs), like MAKER, offer a promising paradigm.

    "summary": "The EU's revised Chat Control proposal (Child Sexual Abuse Regulation - CSAR) has moved forward to Coreper, causing significant concern among privacy experts despite appearing \"softer.\" While mandatory scanning of private chats, photos, and URLs was ostensibly removed, critics warn that Article 4’s vague ‘risk mitigation’ clause could still compel \"high-risk\" services to implement client-side scanning, effectively reintroducing mandatory surveillance before encryption.\n\nKey concerns include the severe limitation of anonymous communication due to proposed age-verification rules, impacting journalists, whistleblowers, and vulnerable individuals. The proposal’s scope has also expanded to include scanning private chat text and metadata, not just media, raising fears of large-scale monitoring of 450 million EU citizens.\n\nExperts reiterate that safe CSAM detection in encrypted environments remains technically unviable, citing Apple's abandonment of similar client-side scanning features after backlash. They characterize the new version as a \"political trick,\" making superficial concessions while preserving pathways to mass surveillance through broad interpretations.\n\nThe proposal now proceeds to Coreper for approval, followed by a fast trilogue with the European Parliament. Privacy groups fear Parliament might succumb to political pressure, ultimately undermining end-to-end encryption and digital anonymity across the EU.",

    "summary": "Effective Altruism (EA) emerged from Peter Singer's 1971 essay \"Famine, Affluence, and Morality\" and his \"drowning child\" thought experiment, which argues affluent Westerners have a moral obligation to alleviate global suffering if they can do so without significant personal sacrifice. Inspired by Singer's radical claim, Oxford philosophers Toby Ord and Will MacAskill founded Giving What We Can in 2009, encouraging members to donate 10% of their income, and 80,000 Hours, advising on career impact.\n\nDavid Edmonds, author of \"Death in a Shallow Pond,\" explains that EA's ambition from the start was to build a movement to change the world. While Singer's utilitarianism is highly demanding, some EAs temper this, dedicating only a portion of their lives to maximizing good. EA faces critiques for its individualistic solutions to poverty, potentially ignoring structural issues. Edmonds notes EAs are pragmatic; if structural change proves most effective, they would support it.\n\nOriginally apolitical, EA now navigates a polarized landscape by aiming to remain detached from party politics to avoid alienating support. The movement has also been hit by scandals, including Sam Bankman-Fried's fraud, and a shift towards \"long-termism\" attracting Silicon Valley donors whose values sometimes diverged from EA's original focus on immediate global poverty. Edmonds views these issues as partly inherent to attracting diverse individuals (\"feature\") and partly specific mistakes (\"bug\"), believing EA is learning to avoid over-reliance on wealthy individuals.",

NPR claimed the CPB violated its First Amendment free speech rights and that Trump sought to punish its journalism.\n\nInitially, CPB's board approved a three-year, $36 million grant for NPR to manage the Public Radio Satellite System. However, CPB officials later redirected these funds to a newly created entity, Public Media Infrastructure (PMI), which NPR argued was unauthorized and a result of Trump administration pressure. CPB attorneys denied retaliating against NPR.\n\nThe settlement includes an agreement between NPR and CPB that Trump’s May 2020 executive order, which called for federal agencies to stop funding NPR and PBS, is unconstitutional, and CPB will not enforce it unless legally compelled. NPR, in turn, agreed to drop its request to block CPB from disbursing funds to PMI under a separate grant agreement.\n\nThe settlement does not end the broader lawsuit in which NPR seeks to block the executive order's implementation, with a hearing scheduled for December 4.

This proposal has deeply alarmed statisticians, demographers, and social scientists.\n\nCurrently, the ACS is mandatory for a rotating sample of 3.5 million households annually, providing essential data for federal funding allocation, infrastructure planning, and economic policy. Proponents of the bill, H.R. 8326, argue that mandatory participation infringes on personal liberty and privacy, citing the threat of fines for non-compliance (though these are rarely enforced).\n\nStatisticians warn that making the ACS voluntary would severely undermine its accuracy and utility. Voluntary surveys typically suffer from lower response rates and introduce non-response bias, as those who choose to respond may differ systematically from those who don't. This would lead to less reliable data, particularly for smaller communities and vulnerable populations, impacting the equitable distribution of resources and effective governance.

    "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08544",
    "summary": "This paper introduces LeJEPA, a novel framework designed to bring theoretical grounding and practical simplicity to Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) for self-supervised learning. The authors argue that previous JEPA implementations suffered from a lack of theory, leading to ad-hoc development and reliance on numerous heuristics.\n\nLeJEPA addresses this by first identifying the isotropic Gaussian as the optimal distribution for JEPA embeddings to minimize downstream prediction risk. To enforce this, they propose Sketched Isotropic Gaussian Regularization (SIGReg). Combining SIGReg with the standard JEPA predictive loss yields LeJEPA.\n\nThe resulting objective offers significant advantages: it requires only a single trade-off hyperparameter, boasts linear time and memory complexity, and demonstrates remarkable stability across various hyperparameters, architectures (ResNets, ViTs, ConvNets), and domains. Crucially, LeJEPA is entirely heuristics-free, eliminating the need for stop-gradients, teacher-student setups, or hyperparameter schedulers. Its implementation is lean, requiring approximately 50 lines of code and being distributed training-friendly.\n\nEmpirical validation across over 10 datasets and 60 architectures confirms its effectiveness, with LeJEPA achieving 79% linear evaluation accuracy on ImageNet-1k with a frozen ViT-H/14 backbone.

    "chinese_summary": "本文介绍LeJEPA，这是一个新颖的框架，旨在为自监督学习中的联合嵌入预测架构（JEPA）带来理论基础和实践简易性。作者指出，以往的JEPA实现在理论上有所欠缺，导致了随意开发和对大量启发式方法的依赖。\n\nLeJEPA通过首先确定各向同性高斯分布为JEPA嵌入的最优分布来解决这个问题，以最小化下游预测风险。为强制实现这一点，他们提出了概略化各向同性高斯正则化（SIGReg）。将SIGReg与标准JEPA预测损失相结合，便得到了LeJEPA。\n\n由此得到的目标函数具有显著优势：它只需要一个单一的权衡超参数，拥有线性的时间和内存复杂度，并且在各种超参数、架构（ResNets、ViTs、ConvNets）和领域中都表现出卓越的稳定性。关键是，LeJEPA完全没有启发式方法，无需梯度停止、教师-学生设置或超参数调度器。其实现精简，大约需要50行代码，并且对分布式训练友好。\n\n对10多个数据集和60种架构进行的实证验证证实了其有效性，LeJEPA在使用冻结的ViT-H/14骨干网络时，在ImageNet-1k上达到了79%的线性评估准确率。作者希望LeJEPA的简洁性和理论基础将重新确立自监督预训练作为人工智能研究的核心支柱。"

    "url": "https://www.quantamagazine.org/mixing-is-the-heartbeat-of-deep-lakes-at-crater-lake-its-slowing-down-20251114/",
    "summary": "Deep lakes worldwide are experiencing a concerning slowdown in their natural mixing processes, a critical phenomenon for distributing oxygen and nutrients, described as their \"heartbeat.\" This decline, primarily driven by climate change, has severe ecological implications.\n\nCrater Lake, the deepest and clearest lake in the United States, serves as a vital research site due to its pristine conditions and over a century of consistent monitoring. Scientists have observed that since 2010, Crater Lake’s water has become *even clearer*, a counterintuitive indicator of underlying problems. Average surface water temperatures have risen by 3 degrees Celsius since 1965, with warmer summer nights and longer summer periods. This warming creates a thinner, warmer surface layer, increasing the density barrier with colder deep water and making mixing more difficult. The increased clarity results from reduced phytoplankton populations, which thrive in the warm surface layer.\n\nThis trend is global; a 2021 study showed increased stratification in 84% of 189 temperate lakes. Italy's deep northern lakes, for example, haven't fully mixed since 2006, leading to profound oxygen depletion at depth and ecosystem shifts. Crater Lake's essential winter mixing, driven by a phenomenon called reverse stratification, is also weakening due to warmer winter air. The weakening of both summer and winter mixing threatens the lake's delicate balance, impacting aquatic life and serving as a canary in the coal mine for other deep lakes globally.",

    "chinese_summary": "全球深水湖泊的自然混合过程正在经历令人担忧的减缓，这种现象对于氧气和营养物质的分布至关重要，被描述为湖泊的“心跳”。这种主要由气候变化引起的减缓，带来了严重的生态影响。\n\n火山口湖是美国最深、最清澈的湖泊，因其原始条件和一个多世纪以来的持续监测，成为重要的研究地点。科学家观察到，自2010年以来，火山口湖的水变得*更加清澈*，这反常地预示着潜在的问题。自1965年以来，湖面平均水温已上升3摄氏度，夏季夜晚变暖，夏季持续时间也更长。这种变暖形成了一层更薄、更温暖的表层水，增加了与较冷深层水之间的密度障碍，使混合更加困难。清澈度增加的原因是浮游植物数量减少，而它们原本在温暖的表层水中茁壮成长。\n\n这种趋势是全球性的；2021年的一项研究显示，在189个温带湖泊中，有84%的湖泊分层现象加剧。例如，意大利北部的深水湖泊自2006年以来一直未能完全混合，导致深层水域氧气严重耗尽和生态系统发生变化。火山口湖由逆分层现象驱动的关键冬季混合，也由于冬季气温升高而减弱。夏季和冬季混合的减弱威胁着湖泊的微妙平衡，影响水生生物，并成为全球其他深水湖泊的“煤矿金丝雀”。"
