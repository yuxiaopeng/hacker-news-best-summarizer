    "url": "https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/bose-open-sources-its-soundtouch-home-theater-smart-speakers-ahead-of-eol/",
    "summary": "Bose has announced a significant reversal for its impending end-of-life (EoL) for SoundTouch Wi-Fi speakers and soundbars, which were initially set to become \"dumb\" speakers on February 18. The original October announcement stated these expensive devices ($399-$1,500) would lose Wi-Fi, cloud connectivity, app control, multi-room audio, music service integration, and updates, limiting them to AUX, HDMI, or Bluetooth. This decision had frustrated many long-time customers.\n\nToday, Bose delivered better news. In an email to customers, the company confirmed that AirPlay and Spotify Connect will continue to work with SoundTouch speakers after EoL. Additionally, AirPlay 2-compatible devices will retain multi-room audio capabilities. The SoundTouch app will also live on, receiving an update on May 6, 2026, to support local functions without cloud reliance, and Bose provided a workaround for saving presets.\n\nCrucially, Bose has released the Application Programming Interface (API) documentation for SoundTouch. This move allows independent developers to create custom tools and features, offering a lifeline to devices that might otherwise have become e-waste. While some functionality is still lost, this open-sourcing decision is seen as a more merciful approach to product discontinuation compared to the common industry practice of \"bricking\" smart devices. The article advocates for such actions, including open-sourcing APIs and striving to maintain functionality, to become standard practice for smart device manufacturers when discontinuing products.",

    "chinese_summary": "博士公司宣布对其即将终止服务的SoundTouch Wi-Fi音箱和回音壁做出重大调整，这些设备原定于2月18日“变笨”（失去智能功能）。最初在10月份的声明中称，这些昂贵的设备（399至1500美元）将失去Wi-Fi、云连接、应用控制、多房间音频、音乐服务集成和更新，仅限于通过AUX、HDMI或蓝牙连接使用。这一决定曾让许多老客户感到沮丧。\n\n今天，博士公司带来了更好的消息。在致客户的电子邮件中，该公司确认，在SoundTouch音箱终止服务后，AirPlay和Spotify Connect将继续支持这些设备。此外，兼容AirPlay 2的设备将保留多房间音频功能。SoundTouch应用也将得以保留，并将在2026年5月6日获得更新，以支持不依赖云的本地功能。博士公司还提供了一个保存预设的变通方法。\n\n至关重要的是，博士公司已经发布了SoundTouch的应用程序编程接口（API）文档。此举允许独立开发者创建自定义工具和功能，为那些否则可能成为电子垃圾的设备提供了一线生机。尽管部分功能仍然丧失，但与行业常见的“变砖”（使其完全失效）智能设备的做法相比，这一开源决定被视为一种更仁慈的产品停产方式。文章倡导，当智能设备制造商停产产品时，应将开源API和努力维护功能等做法变为标准实践。"

    "summary": "Donald Trump, if re-elected, plans to ban large institutional investors from buying single-family homes. Speaking at a campaign rally in Las Vegas, Trump announced this proposal, stating its purpose is to make housing more affordable for American families and provide young people with a better chance at homeownership.\n\nHe criticized these institutional investors, including hedge funds and private equity firms, for \"fleecing\" families by acquiring vast numbers of homes, thereby driving up prices and reducing available inventory for individual buyers. Such investors significantly increased their market share, particularly during the pandemic-era housing boom. Critics argue their widespread purchases contribute to housing unaffordability and convert potential owner-occupied homes into rentals.\n\nTrump's proposed ban aims to curb this trend, alleviate competition in the housing market, and stabilize prices, ultimately seeking to promote greater homeownership opportunities for the general populace as part of his broader economic agenda.",

    "title": "How to Code Claude Code in 200 Lines of Code",
    "url": "https://www.mihaileric.com/The-Emperor-Has-No-Clothes/",
    "summary": "The article \"How to Code Claude Code in 200 Lines of Code\" demystifies AI coding assistants, demonstrating that their core functionality can be replicated in approximately 200 lines of Python. The underlying mental model is a simple conversational loop: a user sends a message, an LLM (Large Language Model) decides if it needs a tool, the program executes that tool locally, and the result is fed back to the LLM, which then continues the conversation or responds. The LLM itself never directly interacts with the filesystem; it delegates tasks to the local program.\n\nThree essential tools are implemented: `read_file_tool` (to get file content), `list_files_tool` (to navigate directories), and `edit_file_tool` (to create new files or replace text). The `edit_file_tool` uses an empty `old_str` to signify file creation.\n\nA key step is \"teaching\" the LLM about these tools. This is done by dynamically generating a `SYSTEM_PROMPT` containing each tool's name, description (from its docstring), and signature. This prompt also specifies the exact format the LLM must use to call a tool: `tool: TOOL_NAME({JSON_ARGS})`. A parser then extracts these tool invocations from the LLM's responses.\n\nThe core `run_coding_agent_loop` manages the interaction: an outer loop takes user input, and an inner loop calls the LLM. If the LLM responds with a tool call, the tool is executed, its result is appended to the conversation as `tool_result(...)`, and the inner loop reiterates. This allows for chained tool calls. If the LLM doesn't call a tool, its response is displayed, and the inner loop breaks.\n\nWhile production agents include features like advanced error handling, streaming, and more tools, the article concludes that this fundamental LLM-tool execution loop is the architectural core of even sophisticated AI coding assistants.",
    "chinese_title": "如何用 200 行代码编写 Claude 代码",
    "chinese_summary": "文章《如何用200行代码编写Claude代码》揭示了AI编码助手的神秘面纱，展示了其核心功能可以用大约200行Python代码实现。其底层心智模型是一个简单的对话循环：用户发送一条消息，大型语言模型（LLM）判断是否需要工具，程序在本地执行该工具，并将结果反馈给LLM，LLM随后继续对话或作出回应。LLM本身从不直接与文件系统交互；它将任务委托给本地程序。\n\n实现了三个基本工具：`read_file_tool`（用于获取文件内容）、`list_files_tool`（用于导航目录）和`edit_file_tool`（用于创建新文件或替换文本）。`edit_file_tool`使用空字符串`old_str`来表示文件创建。\n\n关键一步是“教导”LLM了解这些工具。这通过动态生成一个`SYSTEM_PROMPT`来完成，该提示包含每个工具的名称、描述（来自其文档字符串）和签名。该提示还指定了LLM调用工具必须使用的确切格式：`tool: TOOL_NAME({JSON_ARGS})`。然后，一个解析器从LLM的响应中提取这些工具调用。\n\n核心的`run_coding_agent_loop`管理着交互：一个外部循环接收用户输入，一个内部循环调用LLM。如果LLM响应一个工具调用，该工具就会被执行，其结果以`tool_result(...)`的形式附加到对话中，内部循环则重复执行。这允许了链式工具调用。如果LLM不调用工具，则显示其响应，内部循环终止。\n\n尽管生产级智能体包含高级错误处理、流式传输和更多工具等功能，但文章总结道，这种基本的LLM-工具执行循环是即使是复杂的AI编码助手的架构核心。"

This extremely low adoption rate is significantly below global averages and has shown little substantive change over time, suggesting a widespread absence of IPv6 deployment by Iranian Internet Service Providers and very limited usage among end-users. The dashboard's 'Protocol Adoption' section clearly illustrates this disparity. While not detailing a specific blackout event, the data paints a picture where IPv6 connectivity is virtually non-existent across the nation, making Iran one of the least IPv6-enabled countries globally.",
