    "summary": "In December 1975, Cardiff couple Rob and Dianne Parsons invited Ronnie Lockwood, a homeless man Rob vaguely remembered, into their home for Christmas. Ronnie, who was autistic and had been homeless since age 15 after a difficult upbringing in care, arrived with just a bin bag and a frozen chicken. What started as an act of goodwill turned into a 45-year companionship.\n\nAged 27 and 26, Rob and Dianne initially planned for Ronnie to stay only for the holidays. However, confronted with the \"Catch 22\" of homelessness, they couldn't bring themselves to turn him back out. Ronnie gradually became an integral part of their family, finding stability and love he'd never known. They helped him secure a job as a waste collector and bought him new clothes. Ronnie, in turn, enriched their lives, helping raise their two children, Lloyd and Katie, and often displaying immense kindness, even giving his shoes to a homeless man.\n\nDespite challenges like Ronnie's 20-year gambling addiction, the Parsons affirmed their commitment to him when he expressed fears of being a burden, promising to be \"firm friends forever.\" Ronnie died in 2020 at 75. His legacy includes a wellbeing centre, Lockwood House, named in his honour. Remarkably, Ronnie left £40,000 in his will, the exact amount needed to fund roof repairs for the centre, fulfilling Rob's sentiment that \"the homeless man put the roof over all of our heads.\" The couple reflects that their lives were profoundly enriched by Ronnie, a journey that unfolded \"a day at a time.\"",

    "chinese_summary": "1975年12月，卡迪夫夫妇罗布和黛安·帕森斯邀请了罗布隐约记得的一位名叫罗尼·洛克伍德的流浪汉到家中过圣诞。罗尼患有自闭症，并且在寄养家庭度过艰难童年后，15岁起就无家可归。他来的时候只带了一个垃圾袋和一只冰冻鸡。最初只是一次善举，却发展成了长达45年的陪伴。\n\n当时27岁的罗布和26岁的黛安最初只打算让罗尼待到假期结束。然而，面对流浪生活中的“第22条军规”困境，他们不忍心再把他赶出去。罗尼逐渐成为了他们家庭不可或缺的一员，找到了他从未有过的稳定和爱。他们帮助他找到了一份垃圾回收员的工作，并给他买了新衣服。罗尼也反过来丰富了他们的生活，帮助抚养他们的两个孩子劳埃德和凯蒂，并且经常表现出极大的善意，甚至将自己的鞋子送给了一个流浪汉。\n\n尽管罗尼有长达20年的赌博成瘾等挑战，当他表示害怕成为负担时，帕森斯夫妇向他重申了他们的承诺，承诺会“永远是坚定的朋友”。罗尼于2020年去世，享年75岁。他的遗产包括一个以他命名的福利中心——洛克伍德之家。令人惊叹的是，罗尼在遗嘱中留下了4万英镑，恰好是该中心屋顶维修所需的费用，从而实现了罗布“这个流浪汉为我们所有人遮风挡雨”的感慨。夫妇俩反思，他们的生活因罗尼而得到深刻的丰富，这段旅程是“一天一天”地展开的。"

    "url": "https://www.raptitude.com/2025/12/maybe-the-default-settings-are-too-high/",
    "summary": "The author contends that our habitual \"default settings\" for consuming things like books and food are often too high, preventing us from fully experiencing their richness. Citing his own experience reading *Lord of the Rings* aloud at an \"absurdly\" slow pace, he found that giving each sentence ample time allowed the story to \"blossom,\" yielding significantly more meaning and engagement.\n\nThis principle extends to eating: slowing down reveals more enjoyment from a smaller quantity of food, as increased attention allows the \"good stuff\" to be released automatically. The article draws an analogy to vacuuming a carpet slowly to capture more dirt; our minds' receptors for meaning also need more time to process and connect.\n\nThe author suggests that modern living, with its endless supply of consumables, pushes us towards rapid intake, making us gloss over details and prioritize quantity over quality. This rush, however, paradoxically leads to less satisfaction. Slowing down, by contrast, enhances comprehension and reveals deeper value, exposing the emptiness of surface-level consumption (like \"AI slop\" or \"waxy chocolate\") while allowing the profoundness of well-crafted experiences (like classic novels or homemade pastries) to emerge. The piece encourages readers to experiment with significantly reducing their consumption speed to discover the heightened rewards available.",
    "chinese_title": "可能默认设置太高了",
    "chinese_summary": "作者认为，我们习惯性的、针对书籍和食物等消费的“默认设置”往往过高，这妨碍了我们充分体验其丰富性。他以自己“慢得荒谬”地朗读《指环王》的经历为例，发现给予每个句子充足时间，能让故事“绽放”，从而收获多得多的意义和沉浸感。\n\n这一原则也适用于饮食：放慢速度能从更少量的食物中获得更多乐趣，因为更集中的注意力能让“好东西”自动释放出来。文章将其比作缓慢吸尘以吸走更多污垢；我们大脑中捕捉意义的“感受器”同样需要更多时间来处理和连接。\n\n作者认为，现代生活无休止的消费品供应促使我们快速摄取，导致我们忽略细节，重数量而非质量。然而，这种匆忙却自相矛盾地导致满足感降低。相比之下，放慢速度能增强理解力，揭示更深层的价值，暴露出肤浅消费（如“AI粗制滥造品”或“口感蜡质的巧克力”）的空洞，同时让精心制作的体验（如经典小说或自制糕点）的深刻性得以显现。文章鼓励读者尝试大幅降低消费速度，以发现其中蕴藏的更高回报。"

    "summary": "Ruby 4.0.0 introduces two major new features: \"Ruby Box\" and \"ZJIT.\" Ruby Box is an experimental isolation mechanism allowing separate definitions (e.g., monkey patches, global variables) within a single Ruby process, ideal for testing or blue-green deployments. ZJIT is a new experimental Just-In-Time compiler, replacing YJIT, designed for higher performance and broader contribution, though it's not yet production-ready.\n\nRactor, Ruby's parallel execution feature, receives significant enhancements, including the new `Ractor::Port` class for improved message communication, `Ractor.shareable_proc` for sharing Proc objects, and internal optimizations that reduce global lock contention and improve CPU cache efficiency. Ractor is expected to exit experimental status next year.\n\nLanguage changes include `*nil` no longer invoking `nil.to_a`, and logical binary operators (`||`, `&&`, `and`, `or`) now fluently continuing previous lines.\n\nCore class updates are plentiful: `Array#rfind` and `Array#find` are added, `Binding` gains `implicit_parameters` for numbered parameters, `Enumerator.produce` now accepts a `size` argument, `ErrorHighlight` shows both caller and callee for `ArgumentError`, `Kernel#inspect` allows customization via `instance_variables_to_inspect`, and `Pathname` and `Set` are promoted to core classes.\n\nCompatibility changes include the removal of several `Ractor` methods (`yield`, `take`, `close_incoming`, `close_outgoing`) due to `Ractor::Port`. `ObjectSpace._id2ref` is deprecated, and `Process::Status#&` and `Process::Status#>>` are removed. The CGI library (except escape functions) and `SortedSet` have been removed from default gems. Backtraces no longer display internal frames. RubyGems and Bundler are updated to version 4.0.3.",
    "chinese_title": "Ruby 4.0.0",

    "summary": "Nvidia has agreed to acquire key assets, including inference technology and talent, from AI chip startup Groq for $20 billion in cash. This marks Nvidia's largest-ever acquisition, dwarfing its previous record of $7 billion for Mellanox in 2019.\n\nThe deal is structured as a \"non-exclusive licensing agreement\" for Groq's inference technology, with Groq founder and CEO Jonathan Ross, President Sunny Madra, and other senior leaders joining Nvidia to advance the licensed technology. While Nvidia is gaining Groq's assets and IP, Groq itself will continue to operate as an independent company, led by its CFO, Simon Edwards, and its GroqCloud business is excluded from the transaction.\n\nGroq, founded in 2016 by creators of Google's Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) – a direct competitor to Nvidia's GPUs in AI workloads – was valued at $6.9 billion just three months prior when it raised $750 million. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated the acquisition aims to integrate Groq's low-latency processors into Nvidia's AI factory architecture, expanding its platform for AI inference and real-time workloads.\n\nThis strategic move is consistent with Nvidia's broader strategy of investing heavily in AI startups and talent through various licensing deals, leveraging its significant cash reserves. The company has made similar, smaller deals and holds substantial investments in other AI-centric companies. Groq had been targeting $500 million in revenue this year, driven by high demand for its accelerator chips.",

    "url": "https://git.dec05eba.com/phoenix/about/",
    "summary": "Phoenix is a new X server written from scratch in Zig, aiming to be a modern, simpler, and safer alternative to Xorg. It's not yet ready for general use, currently capable of rendering simple hardware-accelerated GLX, EGL, or Vulkan applications nested within an existing X server.\n\nKey goals include simplicity, supporting a subset of the X11 protocol relevant to modern applications (last ~20 years), and recent hardware (last ~15-20 years) via Linux DRM and Mesa GBM, without Xorg's server driver interface. Security is paramount, with automatic protocol parsing, Zig's safety features, and application isolation by default. Applications will require GUI prompts for sensitive actions (e.g., screen recording) or explicit pre-launch permissions. Global hotkeys require a modifier key unless otherwise permitted.\n\nPhoenix also aims for improved support for modern technology, including proper multi-monitor handling (different refresh rates, VRR, HDR), built-in tear-free compositing (with lower latency), and new standards like per-monitor DPI. The X11 protocol will be extended for new features, and Wayland compatibility is a target. Its nested display server capability aids debugging and development.\n\nNon-goals include replacing the Xorg server (which will retain broader feature/hardware support), X11 \"screens,\" `GrabServer` functionality, or indirect GLX. It deviates from the core X11 protocol by not implementing many old font operations and treating strings as UTF-8 by default. Phoenix asserts that perceived \"fundamental issues\" with X11 are often specific to the Xorg server, not the protocol itself.",

In 2014, he acquired the expired domain VidaliaOnions.com for $2,200 on a whim, initially having no business plan. His philosophy is to let domain names inspire and guide business ventures, rather than starting with a solid idea.\n\nDespite lacking farming experience or infrastructure, the domain \"kept nudging\" him. In February 2015, he decided to mimic the farm-to-door service of fruit companies. He connected with the Vidalia Onion Committee, which introduced him to farmers. He partnered with Aries Haygood, whose 25-year-old farm grew award-winning Vidalias and had a packing shed.\n\nTheir initial conservative estimate of 50 orders for the 2015 season exploded to over 600. Askew focused on customer service, marketing, branding, web development, and logistics, while the farm managed the onions. Their collaboration led to significant growth, with even competitors directing customers their way. They experimented with diverse marketing and added a phone order hotline, which sometimes outperforms online sales.\n\nAskew faced challenges, including a $10,000 mistake with faulty shipping boxes, which almost shut them down. However, customer enthusiasm, like being called \"THE VIDALIA MAN!\", reinforced his commitment. Entering their 5th season, he emphasizes finding immense gratification and purpose over profit in the business.",
