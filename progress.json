    "summary": "This imagined Hacker News front page from 10 years in the future (envisioned by Gemini Pro 3) highlights significant technological advancements and persistent societal debates.\n\nKey breakthroughs include:\n*   **Space & Energy:** Starship HLS-9 successfully sending telemetry from the Sea of Tranquility, and ITER achieving net positive energy for 20 consecutive minutes.\n*   **Software & Hardware:** A 100% Rust kernel upstream in Linux 7.4, LLaMA-12 7B running on contact lenses with WASM, SQLite 4.0 release, and the emergence of \"Post-Silicon Computing\" with photonic circuits.\n*   **Biotech:** FDA approval for over-the-counter CRISPR for lactose intolerance.\n\nAI remains a central, often contentious, topic. While autonomous coding agents are launching, there are strong opinions on writing \"raw code\" versus \"prompting the compiler,\" debates on whether AI progress is stalling, and even a \"Show HN\" for a text editor *without* AI. Google is imagined to have killed Gemini Cloud Services, adding a touch of irony given the source.\n\nSocietal impacts and privacy concerns are also prominent, with the EU passing a \"Right to Human Verification\" Act, discussions on preventing ad-injection in AR glasses, reverse engineering Neuralink, and guides for deep fake detection for seniors. The page also features classic Hacker News themes like new Debian releases, debates on rewriting `sudo` in Zig, and the cyclical return of functional programming and server-side rendering.",
    "chinese_title": "展示 HN: Gemini Pro 3 想象十年后的 HN 首页",
    "chinese_summary": "这份设想中的十年后Hacker News首页（由Gemini Pro 3构想）突出了重大的技术进步和持续的社会争论。\n\n主要突破包括：\n*   **太空与能源：** 星舰HLS-9成功从静海发送遥测数据，以及国际热核聚变实验堆（ITER）连续20分钟实现净能量增益。\n*   **软件与硬件：** Linux 7.4内核代码完全采用Rust语言，LLaMA-12 7B借助WASM在隐形眼镜上运行，SQLite 4.0发布，以及光子电路带来的“后硅计算”的兴起。\n*   **生物技术：** FDA批准用于乳糖不耐受的非处方CRISPR疗法。\n\n人工智能仍然是一个核心的、常常引发争议的话题。尽管自主编码代理正在推出，但关于编写“原始代码”与“提示编译器”之间存在激烈意见，关于人工智能进展是否停滞的辩论，甚至有一个“Show HN”展示了*不含*AI的文本编辑器。考虑到原文的来源，谷歌被设想已终止Gemini云服务，这增添了一丝讽刺意味。\n\n社会影响和隐私问题也十分突出，欧盟通过了“人工验证权”法案，关于阻止AR眼镜中广告植入的讨论，逆向工程Neuralink，以及面向老年人的深度伪造检测指南。该页面还包含Hacker News的经典主题，例如新的Debian版本发布、关于用Zig重写`sudo`的辩论，以及函数式编程和服务器端渲染的周期性回归。"

    "summary": "LWN.net reported on December 10, 2025, that the \"Rust in the kernel experiment\" has concluded successfully. At the annual Maintainers Summit, developers reached a consensus that Rust is no longer experimental but is now a core and permanent component of the Linux kernel, leading to the removal of its \"experimental\" tag.\n\nThe article's headline, \"The (successful) end of the kernel Rust experiment,\" initially caused widespread misinterpretation among readers who thought Rust was being removed. Editor corbet clarified that the phrasing was unintentional and simply meant the *successful completion* of the experimental phase.\n\nThe comments section subsequently delved into a lengthy discussion about the quality and style of tech news site Phoronix, often comparing it to LWN.net, particularly regarding clickbait headlines and benchmark utility. Another notable comment pointed out that even Microsoft is incorporating Rust into the Windows kernel, including shipped components, humorously debunking the idea of switching OSs to avoid Rust's presence.",

    "chinese_summary": "LWN.net 在 2025 年 12 月 10 日报道，\"内核 Rust 实验\"已圆满结束。在年度维护者峰会上，开发人员达成共识，认为 Rust 不再是实验性的，而是 Linux 内核的一个核心且永久的组件，因此移除了其\"实验性\"标签。\n\n该文章的标题，\"内核 Rust 实验的（成功）结束\"，最初引起了读者的广泛误解，他们以为 Rust 将被移除。编辑 corbet 澄清说，这个措辞并非有意为之，仅仅是指实验阶段的*圆满完成*。\n\n评论区随后深入探讨了科技新闻网站 Phoronix 的质量和风格，经常将其与 LWN.net 进行比较，特别是在标题党和基准测试实用性方面。另一个值得注意的评论指出，即使是微软也在将 Rust 整合到 Windows 内核中，包括已交付的组件，这幽默地驳斥了通过切换操作系统来避免 Rust 存在的想法。"

    "summary": "Let's Encrypt celebrates its 10th anniversary of public certificate issuance, marking a decade of transforming web security. Since its first certificate in September 2015, it has become the world's largest Certificate Authority, issuing billions of certificates and protecting nearly a billion websites.\n\nThe organization's success is attributed to its vision of scalability through automation and the widespread adoption of its ACME protocol. Issuance volume dramatically increased from one million certificates in March 2016 to frequently over ten million per day by late 2025. This growth directly led to a significant increase in HTTPS encryption, from under 30% to approximately 80% globally and 95% in the U.S., achieving its goal of measurable security impact.\n\nKey milestones include reaching a billion total certificates issued by 2020, introducing features like wildcard support (2018), and continuous infrastructure upgrades to handle massive data. The project also managed critical PKI engineering, including initial cross-signatures with IdenTrust and establishing its own root CA.\n\nLet's Encrypt's aim is to make certificates so seamless they are taken for granted, yet this invisibility necessitates continued support and recognition. Honored with awards like the Levchin Prize, the project was launched with vital support from initial sponsors like Mozilla, EFF, Cisco, Akamai, and particularly IdenTrust. As a nonprofit, Let's Encrypt continues to seek donations to pursue its mission of making the Internet more secure and privacy-respecting.",

It features a 256K context window, is significantly more cost-efficient than competitors, and is released under a modified MIT license. It supports production-grade workflows, codebase exploration, and fine-tuning, requiring a minimum of 4 H100-class GPUs for deployment.\n*   **Devstral Small 2 (24B):** Scoring 68.0% on SWE-bench Verified, this model is deployable locally on consumer hardware or even CPU-only configurations. It offers fast inference, customization, and supports image inputs, released under Apache 2.0.\n\nBoth models are considerably smaller than competing models like DeepSeek V3.2 and Kimi K2, making them more accessible. They are initially free to use via Mistral's API, with future tiered pricing.\n\n**Mistral Vibe CLI** is an open-source (Apache 2.0) command-line coding assistant powered by Devstral. It enables end-to-end code automation using natural language directly in the terminal or integrated into IDEs (like Zed). Key features include project-aware context, smart references, multi-file orchestration, and programmable scripting, aiming to streamline software engineering tasks.\n\nThis release emphasizes accelerating distributed intelligence and lowering barriers for developers, small businesses, and hobbyists by providing powerful, accessible coding AI tools.",
