    "summary": "The author reflects on a period of profound uncertainty while applying to graduate school, having faced rejections previously and feeling disadvantaged by a less-than-ideal academic and professional profile. During this challenging time, a friend offered a recurring maxim: \"All it takes is for one to work out.\" Despite initial skepticism, this proved true when a single acceptance changed the author's life.\n\nThis powerful framing, the author notes, is applicable to any high-stakes search. In job hunting, one only needs the right fit, not every offer. For housing, one just needs the place that feels like home. In relationships, one only needs that one person. And for education, a single university acceptance can open the right door.\n\nThese processes—like college admissions, job searches, home buying, or finding a partner—can be emotionally brutal and feel deeply personal. However, the simple truth that \"All it takes is for one to work out\" serves as a grounding reminder that a single success is all that's truly needed to achieve a life-changing outcome.",

    "summary": "A former NASA engineer and Google Cloud AI specialist contends that datacenters in space, particularly for AI, are a \"catastrophically bad idea\" due to fundamental challenges.\n\n**Power:** Space offers no abundant power. An ISS-sized solar array (200kW) could power only about 200 modern GPUs (roughly three server racks). Matching a 100,000-GPU datacenter would require 500 such enormous satellites. Nuclear radioisotope generators are woefully insufficient.\n\n**Thermal Regulation:** Space's vacuum means no convection cooling. Heat transfer relies on conduction and radiation. Cooling 200 GPUs (200kW) would necessitate a radiator panel system of approximately 531 square metres, significantly larger than the entire ISS thermal system, for minimal compute capacity.\n\n**Radiation Tolerance:** Space radiation causes single-event upsets (bit flips), single-event latch-ups (permanent damage), and long-term performance degradation. Modern GPUs/TPUs, with their small geometries and large die areas, are highly vulnerable. Shielding is largely impractical due to mass, and designing radiation-hardened chips drastically reduces performance to that of decades-old processors, making them unsuitable for AI.\n\n**Communications:** Satellite communication typically yields only about 1Gbps, a fraction of the 100Gbps+ bandwidth common in ground-based datacenters.\n\nUltimately, the author concludes that space datacenters would be disproportionately costly, extremely difficult to implement, and deliver only mediocre performance, rendering the concept unfeasible.",

    "summary": "A new NBC News poll reveals a dramatic decline in how Americans perceive the value of a four-year college degree. Just 33% of registered voters now believe it's \"worth the cost\" for better job prospects and higher earnings, a significant drop from 53% in 2013. Conversely, 63% now consider it \"not worth the cost\" due to substantial debt and a perceived lack of specific job skills.\n\nThis eye-popping shift over 12 years is largely driven by soaring tuition prices; inflation-adjusted costs for public four-year colleges have doubled since 1995, and private college tuition is up 75%. Rapid changes in the modern economy, including AI advancements, also contribute to the skepticism.\n\nThe decline in sentiment is widespread, affecting virtually every demographic. Republicans show the most dramatic shift (55% worth it in 2013 to 22% now), while Democrats also saw a significant drop (61% to 47%). Notably, less than half (46%) of voters with college degrees now deem them worth the cost, down from 63%.\n\nGraduates like Jacob Kennedy exemplify the struggle, often finding entry-level jobs don't cover student loan debt, pushing them back to service industry roles. Jessica Burns emphasizes that while a degree is often a prerequisite for interviews, its intrinsic value is overshadowed by its prohibitive cost.\n\nThis has fueled a surge in interest in technical, vocational, and two-year programs, as students prioritize faster entry into the workforce. Experts view this as a \"remarkable\" societal shift, signaling a crisis for higher education which is increasingly seen as out of touch and inaccessible, eroding its status as a core component of the American Dream.",

    "title": "How good engineers write bad code at big companies",
    "url": "https://www.seangoedecke.com/bad-code-at-big-companies/",
    "summary": "The article explores why competent engineers at large tech companies sometimes produce \"bad\" code, attributing it to systemic issues rather than individual incompetence.\n\nThe primary reason is the constant churn of engineers and frequent internal mobility. Big tech compensation packages often incentivize engineers to leave after 1-2 years, and internal re-organizations frequently move engineers to new teams or codebases. This means a high percentage of code changes are made by \"beginners\" — engineers new to the specific system, language, or even the company itself.\n\nWhile \"old hands\" with deep expertise exist, their ability to mitigate this is limited. Companies make little effort to retain or formalize this expertise, and these experienced engineers are often overloaded, leading to rushed code reviews and insufficient involvement in decision-making.\n\nThe \"median productive engineer\" at a big tech company is therefore often working on unfamiliar code under tight deadlines, an environment not conducive to producing quality code. The author argues that big tech companies *deliberately* make this trade-off: they prioritize the ability to rapidly redeploy \"fungible\" engineers to \"problem-of-the-month\" projects (like AI pivots) over fostering deep, long-term expertise and pristine code quality. Bad code is a known, accepted consequence of this strategic flexibility.\n\nIndividual engineers are largely powerless to alter this dynamic. The article concludes that it's a mistake to blame engineers for \"bad\" code; the root cause is the company's organizational strategy that forces engineers to constantly work in unfamiliar codebases.",

    "chinese_summary": "本文探讨了为何大型科技公司的合格工程师有时会产出“糟糕”的代码，并将其归因于系统性问题而非个人能力不足。\n\n主要原因是工程师的持续流失和频繁的内部调动。大型科技公司的薪酬方案通常会激励工程师在1-2年后离职，而内部重组又经常将工程师调往新的团队或代码库。这意味着很大比例的代码更改是由“新手”完成的——这些工程师刚接触特定系统、语言，甚至刚入职公司。\n\n尽管拥有深厚专业知识的“老手”确实存在，但他们缓解这种情况的能力有限。公司很少努力保留或规范这些专业知识，而这些经验丰富的工程师经常工作量过载，导致代码审查草率，并且对决策的参与不足。\n\n因此，大型科技公司的“中位数高效工程师”常常在紧张的截止日期下处理不熟悉的代码，这种环境不利于产出高质量的代码。作者认为，大型科技公司是*故意*做出这种权衡的：他们优先考虑能够快速将“可替代的”工程师重新部署到“月度问题”项目（例如转向AI），而不是培养深厚的长期专业知识和无可挑剔的代码质量。糟糕的代码是这种战略灵活性的一个已知且被接受的后果。\n\n个人工程师基本无力改变这种动态。文章总结认为，将“糟糕”的代码归咎于工程师是错误的；根本原因是公司的组织战略，该战略迫使工程师不断处理不熟悉的代码库。"

    "summary": "Iceland has declared the potential instability and collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) a national security risk, marking the first time a climate impact has received this designation in the country. The AMOC is a vital system of ocean currents that transports warm water northward, significantly shaping Iceland's mild climate. Its collapse would lead to severe regional cooling, increased sea ice surrounding the island, and devastating impacts on infrastructure, transport, and key industries like fishing.\n\nScientists describe the AMOC, a \"conveyor belt\" of warm water, as crucial for global weather patterns. A growing body of research indicates it is slowing down due to rising global temperatures affecting heat and salinity. While the exact timing is uncertain, some studies project a collapse this century, with experts stating it's no longer a low-likelihood risk.\n\nThe global consequences of an AMOC shutdown would be catastrophic: rising sea levels in parts of the US and Europe, disrupted monsoon systems in Asia and Africa, and a deep winter freeze across Europe, with sea ice potentially extending to the UK.\n\nFollowing alarming research, Iceland's Minister for Environment, Energy and Climate, Jóhann Páll Jóhannsson, spearheaded the national security designation. This move ensures a high-level, coordinated government response to prepare for and mitigate what he calls an \"existential threat.\" Jóhannsson emphasized that it's a matter of national survival, as climate change might make adaptation impossible.

    "summary": "Landlock is a Linux API introduced in kernel 5.13, designed to allow applications to explicitly declare and restrict the resources they can access. Operating as an unprivileged Linux Security Module (LSM), its philosophy mirrors OpenBSD's `unveil()` and `pledge()`, enabling programs to contract with the kernel to only access specified files or resources, denying everything else. This provides defense-in-depth, making sandboxing significantly easier for developers compared to traditional Linux security mechanisms.\n\nPolicies are created dynamically at runtime, consisting of \"handled accesses\" (e.g., filesystem read/write) and \"access grants\" (an allowlist of objects permitted for those operations). Once `landlock_restrict_self()` is called, restrictions are permanently enforced on the current thread and its descendants, unable to be revoked, though they can be further reduced through layering. It's stackable with other LSMs like SELinux.\n\nLandlock excels when an application needs predictable file access, such as a web server confined to `/var/www/html`. Unlike SELinux or AppArmor, it requires no administrator involvement or system-wide configuration, embedding policies directly into application code. This addresses shortcomings of existing Linux sandboxing tools like cumbersome containers, overly broad Flatpak/Snap permissions, complex seccomp, or difficult SELinux/AppArmor profiles.\n\nIt promises to enhance security for long-running daemons, desktop applications like PDF readers and web browsers by restricting file access to only what's opened, and FTP/HTTP servers. Future developments include a \"Supervise Mode\" for interactive permission prompts (similar to Android), fine-grained socket restrictions, and improved inheritance controls, paving the way for a more secure Linux desktop experience. Landlock offers a simple, unprivileged, deny-by-default sandboxing solution with immense potential for application and desktop security.",

    "summary": "Feynman's Trick, also known as Differentiation under the Integral Sign or the Leibniz Integral Rule, is a powerful technique for evaluating challenging integrals. While the method dates back to Leibniz, it was popularized by Richard Feynman, who discovered it in an advanced calculus book and found it an invaluable, often overlooked tool that gave him a unique edge in solving complex problems.\n\nThe core idea involves introducing a parameter, \\(t\\), into a difficult integral \\(I = \\int_a^b f(x) dx\\), transforming it into a parameterized function \\(I(t) = \\int_a^b g(x,t) dx\\). The integral is then differentiated with respect to this parameter: \\(\\frac{d}{dt} \\int_a^b f(x, t)dx = \\int_a^b \\frac{\\partial f(x, t)}{\\partial t}dx\\). The goal is for this differentiated integral, \\(I'(t)\\), to be much simpler to evaluate. After finding \\(I'(t)\\), the original integral \\(I\\) is recovered by integrating \\(I'(t)\\) back with respect to \\(t\\), typically using known boundary conditions for \\(I(t)\\).\n\nThe primary challenge lies in intelligently parameterizing the integral. A key rule of thumb is to place the parameter strategically so that differentiating with respect to it simplifies or eliminates a troublesome part of the integrand that is otherwise unrelated to the parameter. For example, in \\(\\int_0^1 \\frac{x-1}{\\ln x}dx\\), parameterizing as \\(I(t)=\\int_0^1 \\frac{x^t-1}{\\ln x}dx\\) removes the logarithm from the denominator upon differentiation. The article stresses that mastery comes through practice and creative problem-solving, as there's no universal formula for parameterization.",

    "summary": "Windows drive letters are not limited to A-Z; symbols like `+:` and non-ASCII characters like `€:` can be assigned as drives, as demonstrated by the `subst` tool. This functionality is rooted in how Windows processes paths internally. High-level Win32 paths (e.g., `C:\\foo`) are converted to NT namespace paths (e.g., `\\??\\C:\\foo`) by APIs like `CreateFileW`.\n\nWithin the NT Object Manager, `\\??` is a virtual folder where objects like `C:` exist as symbolic links pointing to physical device paths. Thus, a drive letter is essentially any character `X` for which `RtlDosPathNameToNtPathName_U` converts `X:\\foo` into `\\??\\X:\\foo`. This explains why `+:` and `€:` work as drive letters in `cmd.exe`.\n\nDespite this underlying flexibility, several limitations exist:\n1.  **File Explorer and PowerShell** do not recognize or allow navigation to non-A-Z drive letters.\n2.  Drive letters are restricted to a single WTF-16 code unit (up to U+FFFF). Characters beyond this range (e.g., `𤭢:`) will not be correctly interpreted as drive-absolute paths by `RtlDosPathNameToNtPathName_U`, rendering them unusable.\n3.  Non-system path APIs (like Rust's `Path::is_absolute`) often only recognize traditional A-Z drive letters.\n4.  The `SetVolumeMountPointW` API exhibits a peculiar bug, truncating non-ASCII drive letters (e.g., `€:` becomes `¬:` due to truncation of its Unicode code point).\n\nThis reveals that while the core Windows path resolution is flexible, high-level applications and some APIs enforce stricter, A-Z conventions.",

    "url": "https://www.iankduncan.com/engineering/2025-11-27-crdt-dictionary/",
    "summary": "The article serves as a field guide to Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs), data structures that enable deterministic merging of concurrent writes across distributed nodes without coordination or data loss. Originating from the author's interest in Riak around 2014, CRDTs solve the problem of achieving eventual consistency where consensus (e.g., Paxos/Raft) might hinder availability or Last-Write-Wins leads to data loss.\n\nThe core principle is that a CRDT's merge operation must be **commutative, associative, and idempotent**, ensuring that replicas converge to the same state regardless of merge order or duplicates. This often relies on the concept of a **lattice**, where data states form a partial order, and updates only move \"upward\" (monotonicity), allowing the merge operation to be a \"join\" (least upper bound).\n\nCRDTs are broadly categorized into state-based (CvRDTs), which send entire states, and operation-based (CmRDTs), which send operations. The guide focuses on state-based types:\n\n*   **G-Counter (Grow-Only Counter)**: Each replica stores its own count; merging takes the `max` of each replica's count. Supports only increments.\n*   **PN-Counter (Positive-Negative Counter)**: Extends G-Counter by maintaining two G-Counters (for increments and decrements) to allow both operations.\n*   **G-Set (Grow-Only Set)**: A set that only supports additions; merge uses set `union`. Elements cannot be removed.\n*   **2P-Set (Two-Phase Set)**: Uses two G-Sets (added and removed). An element is present if in `added` but not `removed`. Once removed, an element cannot be re-added.\n*   **LWW-Element-Set (Last-Write-Wins Element Set)**: Associates each element's add/remove operations with timestamps. An element is present if its latest timestamped operation was an add, allowing re-addition.\n\nCRDTs are valuable for applications needing high availability and resilience to network partitions, like offline-first apps, by designing data structures where conflicts resolve automatically.",

Traditionally known for its crucial role in bone health by aiding calcium absorption and preventing rickets, recent research suggests broader implications for our bodies.\n\nNew insights link vitamin D deficiency to conditions like high blood pressure, where supplements may help, and an increased risk of cardiovascular events, although evidence for supplement efficacy here is mixed. Vitamin D also appears to influence immune health, with links found to the common cold and gene expression related to immune function; however, its ability to prevent acute respiratory infections through supplementation is not strongly supported. Further studies hint at connections to mental health, pregnancy outcomes, and cancer survival.\n\nDespite these \"tantalizing\" potential benefits, the evidence for vitamin D supplementation in many of these areas remains mixed or inconclusive. Challenges for researchers include the difficulty of randomized trials, varying individual responses to sunlight (the primary source), and disagreement on \"ideal\" blood levels of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol. While there is consensus on defining deficiency (below 30 nmol/L), determining precise supplementation needs is complex.

    "summary": "James A. Garfield, the 20th U.S. President, developed an original proof of the Pythagorean theorem, published in the New-England Journal of Education in 1876, while he was a congressman. He remains the only U.S. President to have contributed original mathematics. The proof is considered \"very clever\" by historians and is included in a compendium of 370 proofs.\n\nGarfield's proof involves constructing a trapezoid from a right-angled triangle. Starting with a right triangle ABC (sides a, b, hypotenuse c), he drew a line through B perpendicular to AB and chose point D such that BD = BA. From D, he dropped a perpendicular DE onto the extended line CB. This construction results in two congruent right triangles (ABC and BDE) and an isosceles right triangle (ABD). The overall figure ACED forms a trapezoid.\n\nThe proof proceeds by calculating the area of this trapezoid in two ways:\n1.  Using the trapezoid area formula: The parallel sides are AC (length b) and DE (length a), and the height is CE (length a + b). So, Area = (1/2) * (b + a) * (a + b) = (1/2) * (a + b)^2.\n2.  As the sum of the areas of the three constituent triangles:\n    *   Area of ΔACB = (1/2)ab\n    *   Area of ΔBDE = (1/2)ab (since it's congruent to ΔACB)\n    *   Area of ΔABD = (1/2)c^2 (it's an isosceles right triangle with legs c)\n    So, total Area = (1/2)ab + (1/2)ab + (1/2)c^2 = ab + (1/2)c^2.\n\nEquating the two expressions for the trapezoid's area:\n(1/2)(a + b)^2 = ab + (1/2)c^2\nMultiplying by 2: (a + b)^2 = 2ab + c^2\nExpanding: a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = 2ab + c^2\nSubtracting 2ab from both sides yields the Pythagorean theorem: a^2 + b^2 = c^2.",

It's a single point of control, risking account bans and data loss. The platform has become slow, encourages a \"push model\" over the preferred \"pull model\" for offline work, and lacks adequate moderation tools.

All important data is in git repositories. A lightweight, JavaScript-free git frontend, cgit, is used. A custom bug tracker, \"buggy,\" stores bugs as Markdown files in a git repo, enabling offline work and preventing centralized data loss. Git mirrors are established on Codeberg and Sourcehut for redundancy.\n\nWhile the dillo-browser.org DNS entry is still a single point of failure, OpenPGP signatures (using Rodrigo's GPG key) provide authority independent of DNS or TLS, enhancing resilience.

Initially proposed in 2022, it was repeatedly blocked but persistently repackaged. A revised version, \"Chat Control 2.0,\" was recently greenlit by Coreper, an opaque EU body, bypassing democratic debate and potentially leading to its adoption as early as December.\n\nCritics, including cybersecurity academics and digital rights campaigners, argue this initiative is a dangerous blueprint for generalized surveillance, violating fundamental rights and potentially creating a \"total surveillance machine.\" While removing mandatory general monitoring, the new text encourages \"voluntary\" mass scanning by online platforms, using AI to detect \"grooming\" behaviors. Experts warn that AI is incapable of reliably distinguishing innocent conversations from illicit activity, leading to massive false positives (50-80% of current reports are irrelevant) and exposing intimate communications.\n\nFurthermore, the proposal requires providers to implement \"risk mitigation measures,\" which could force encrypted services like WhatsApp and Signal to scan messages on users' devices before encryption, creating dangerous backdoors. This would compromise global cybersecurity and affect users worldwide. Another critical feature is mandatory age-verification for app stores and messaging services, which critics argue is technologically unworkable, reliant on invasive data, and would effectively end anonymous communication – a vital tool for journalists, whistleblowers, and activists.\n\nOpponents highlight that mass scanning is ineffective against perpetrators using decentralized or encrypted methods and argue it shifts responsibility to opaque corporate algorithms. The EU Court of Justice has previously ruled against such general analysis of private communications. Instead of undermining privacy, critics advocate for targeted surveillance with judicial warrants and the preservation of end-to-end encryption and anonymity.

The growth is fueled by government incentives, including tax breaks and reduced import duties in countries like Brazil and Colombia.\n\nA substantial portion of this electrification trend comes from hybrid-electric vehicles (HEVs), which account for two-thirds of electrified vehicle sales. Consumers often prefer HEVs as a transitional step due to concerns about charging infrastructure availability and EV range anxiety.

    "summary": "Nano PDF is a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool that enables users to edit PDF slides using natural language prompts, leveraging Google's Gemini 3 Pro Image model, affectionately dubbed \"Nano Banana.\"\n\nKey features include:\n*   **Natural Language Editing:** Users can issue commands like \"Update the graph to include data from 2025\" or \"Change the chart to a bar graph.\"\n*   **Add New Slides:** The tool can generate new slides that seamlessly match the existing deck's visual style.\n*   **Non-Destructive Editing:** It preserves the PDF's searchable text layer through an OCR re-hydration process.\n*   **Multi-page & Parallel Processing:** Edits can span multiple pages and are processed concurrently for efficiency.\n\nThe tool works by converting PDF pages to images, using optional style references, sending these images and prompts to Gemini 3 Pro Image for AI generation, restoring the searchable text via Tesseract OCR, and finally stitching the edited pages back into the PDF.\n\nInstallation is via `pip install nano-pdf`, and it requires system dependencies like Poppler and Tesseract. Crucially, a paid Google Gemini API key with billing enabled is necessary, as Gemini 3 Pro Image is not available on the free tier.\n\nUsage involves commands like `nano-pdf edit my_deck.pdf 2 \"Change the title\"` for editing existing pages, and `nano-pdf add my_deck.pdf 0 \"Title slide\"` for inserting new, AI-generated slides. Options allow specifying resolution, output filename, style reference pages, and enabling/disabling full document context or Google Search for the AI.

    "url": "https://roam.be/notes/2025/a-first-look-at-djangos-new-background-tasks/",
    "summary": "Django 6.0 introduces `django.tasks`, a built-in framework for background tasks. Its primary goal is to offer a common API for task queue implementations, rather than being a full-blown solution like Celery. A key distinction is that Django handles task creation and queuing, but **does not provide a worker mechanism**; execution must be managed by external infrastructure.\n\nTasks are defined using the `@task` decorator and must be invoked via `task_instance.enqueue()`, preventing accidental in-process execution. The framework allows specifying priority, queue, and backend, and offers context access for task results. Out-of-the-box, Django 6.0 includes `ImmediateBackend` (executes instantly) and `DummyBackend` (does nothing).\n\nThe article demonstrates creating a custom `DatabaseBackend` and worker for true background processing. This backend uses Django models (`Task`, `Error`, `Attempt`) to store task state, execution attempts, and errors. It supports configurable retries (`max_attempts`) and exponential backoff (`backoff_factor`) at a global or per-queue level.\n\nThe `QueueStore` within the backend handles task lifecycle, including enqueueing, result retrieval, and robustly claiming tasks transactionally to prevent concurrent processing by multiple workers. A `Worker` class utilizes this `QueueStore` to identify, claim, and process available tasks, recording their status, return values, and any errors encountered during execution. This modular approach allows integration with various external execution environments.",

Cloudflare's custom authoritative DNS server, RRDNS (written in Go), manages millions of DNS records, yet only 743 are LOC records.\n\nA customer inquiry revealed that RRDNS was failing to serve these LOC records. Investigation showed that while RRDNS could process LOC requests, it lacked a parser to convert the textual LOC format, as stored in Cloudflare's DNS editor (e.g., \"33 40 31 N 106 28 29 W 10m\"), into its internal, on-the-wire binary format.\n\nThe author explains the formats defined in RFC 1876 (1996). The textual format includes latitude, longitude, and altitude, with optional size and precision. The fixed-size binary format uses 32-bit integers for latitude, longitude, and altitude, and an intriguing 8-bit encoding for size and precision. This 8-bit encoding uses a \"base * 10^power\" representation (e.g., 0x15 = 1e5 cm), allowing a wide range of values from 1cm to extreme distances.\n\nA new parser for the LOC text record type was developed and implemented in RRDNS.

    "summary": "The Dolt Workbench, an open-source SQL workbench, was initially built using Electron, leveraging its Next.js frontend and GraphQL backend. As Electron's drawbacks became apparent, the team explored Tauri, a newer web-to-desktop framework.\n\nNext.js integration differs significantly: Electron relies on the unmaintained Nextron project for Next.js support, requiring workarounds. Tauri, being framework-agnostic, simplifies Next.js integration by using its static-site generation capabilities.\n\nThe main distinction is UI rendering. Electron bundles a full Chromium browser engine, ensuring consistent UI but leading to significant bloat (e.g., 150MB for a simple app). Tauri, however, leverages the system’s native webview, resulting in much lighter applications with minimal compatibility concerns.\n\nFor the backend \"main\" process, Electron uses Node.js, familiar to web developers. Tauri employs Rust, offering robust JavaScript APIs for interacting with system functions, which the author found to be a \"nicer\" abstraction than Electron's IPC.\n\nElectron's bundled Node.js runtime simplifies running Node.js-based sidecars, like the Workbench's GraphQL server. Tauri requires compiling such sidecars into binaries, a common but additional step.\n\nDespite Tauri's advantages in reducing bloat and natural integration, a full migration is currently paused due to two limitations: lack of .appx and .msix bundle support for Windows (complicating Microsoft Store publishing) and issues with MacOS universal binary codesigning.

Agents often attempt to \"one-shot\" projects, leave environments in messy states, or prematurely declare completion. Standard context management like compaction is insufficient.\n\nAnthropic developed a two-fold solution for the Claude Agent SDK: an **Initializer agent** and a **Coding agent**. The Initializer runs once, setting up the environment. It creates a comprehensive JSON \"feature list\" (all initially marked failing to prevent early completion), an `init.sh` script to automate development server setup and initial end-to-end tests, and an initial Git commit with a `claude-progress.txt` file to log actions.\n\nSubsequent **Coding agents** make incremental progress. Each session begins with a ritual: reading Git logs and the progress file, running `pwd`, and executing `init.sh` to quickly get up to speed and verify basic functionality. The agent then selects one high-priority, incomplete feature from the list, implements it, and performs rigorous end-to-end testing using browser automation tools. Critical to success is the instruction for agents to commit progress to Git with descriptive messages and update the `claude-progress.txt` file, ensuring the environment remains in a \"clean state.\" This structured \"harness\" significantly mitigates failure modes, enabling agents to work effectively over extended periods.

This theorem states that if `n` is prime and `b` is not a multiple of `n`, then `b^(n-1) = 1 (mod n)`. Therefore, if one finds a `b` for which `b^(n-1) ≠ 1 (mod n)`, it definitively proves `n` is composite. The text provides a large number `n` and demonstrates its compositeness using `b=2` without revealing its prime factors, thus keeping the \"secret\" (the factors) private.\n\nProving primality with a ZKP is more complex. Fermat's Little Theorem cannot prove a number is prime, only \"probably prime.\" Also, it's unclear what \"secret\" would be withheld when proving primality, as ZKPs typically conceal some information. Practical ZKPs, while not infallible, are designed to be much faster to verify than direct computation.\n\nBeyond mathematics, ZKPs have diverse applications. They can be compared to non-constructive proofs like the Intermediate Value Theorem. Crucially, they are utilized in cryptocurrencies to verify accounting constraints (e.g., inputs equal outputs) without disclosing sensitive transaction details.",

    "summary": "The article argues that building a Network Attached Storage (NAS) device from an old PC is more cost-effective and capable than buying specialized units. Any PC from the last decade, even an old gaming rig or a Dell Optiplex, provides ample power.\n\nFor optimal performance, an Intel processor with QuickSync is recommended for efficient video transcoding, though AMD users can add a cheap GPU. A fast SSD (NVMe or SATA) serves as the boot drive. RAM is crucial, with 8GB being the minimum for TrueNAS or Unraid, but 16GB or more is ideal for virtual machines or containers, and used RAM offers significant savings. Storage costs can be cut by up to 50% using refurbished or recertified hard drives, which the author has used reliably for years.\n\nFor the operating system, TrueNAS (free) or Unraid (paid) are recommended for their NAS-specific features, simplifying setup and management compared to general Linux distros or Windows. After a simple USB installation, the NAS is managed via a web interface. Key initial steps include setting up SMB shares for Windows accessibility and implementing robust backup solutions like Duplicati. The article strongly stresses that a NAS is only one part of a comprehensive backup strategy, and data stored on the NAS itself must also be properly backed up. This DIY approach offers powerful home storage for a fraction of the cost.",

    "summary": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), under Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., has controversially altered its long-held stance that vaccines do not cause autism. The CDC website now uses an asterisk to suggest this claim is \"not evidence-based,\" citing flawed studies and ignoring decades of rigorous research involving millions of patients. This move, which includes funding new vaccine-autism studies and appointing a vaccine skeptic to a senior CDC role, has been condemned by medical groups like the American Medical Association, which warns of \"dangerous consequences.\"\n\nThe article argues this episode reflects a broader threat to scientific integrity through political interference. It contrasts measured scientific language, which demands high burdens of proof, with declarative political rhetoric and conspiratorial thinking, which thrives on conjecture. The Trump Administration is criticized for silencing government scientists, cutting vital research funding, and disbanding independent committees across various health and environmental sectors.\n\nFurthermore, recent proposals from NIH leaders to focus pandemic preparedness solely on promoting general health (diet, exercise) over developing vaccines and treatments are dismissed as dangerously naive. This approach ignores the millions of lives saved by mRNA vaccines and the fact that even healthy individuals can be vulnerable to new pathogens. Drawing a parallel to Soviet biologist Trofim Lysenko, whose politically-backed pseudoscience led to widespread famine, the author warns against allowing institutionalized quackery to undermine American scientific leadership.

    "summary": "This arXiv paper, \"New Kid in the Classroom: Exploring Student Perceptions of AI Coding Assistants\" by Sergio Rojas-Galeano, investigates the impact of AI coding assistants on novice programmers' learning experiences. The study acknowledges these tools as a \"new kid in the classroom,\" necessitating an understanding of student perceptions.\n\nAn exploratory study was conducted with 20 students in an introductory programming course using a two-part exam. Students first accessed AI support for a programming task, then extended the solution unaided. Researchers collected Likert-scale and open-ended responses to understand perceived challenges.\n\nFindings indicate that students viewed AI tools as helpful for grasping code concepts and boosting confidence during the initial development phase. However, a noticeable difficulty emerged when students had to work independently on the extension task. This suggests potential overreliance on AI and deficiencies in foundational knowledge transfer. The study emphasizes a critical need for new pedagogical approaches that effectively integrate AI to genuinely enhance core programming skills, rather than fostering a mere impersonation of them.

He observes an irrational imbalance: while hundreds of billions are poured into GPUs, data centers, and power, there's a distinct lack of investment in ML infrastructure engineers like himself, who focus on software optimization.\n\nWarden contends this makes no economic sense. Companies spending billions monthly on often underutilized GPUs could achieve significant savings and reduce environmental impact by investing hundreds of millions annually in efficiency improvements, including running inference on much cheaper CPUs.\n\nHe attributes this misallocation to \"signaling benefits\" and management convenience. Startups like OpenAI use massive GPU purchases as a \"moat\" to signal dominance and attract investment, a strategy mirrored by tech giants for positive media coverage and stock boosts. Additionally, hardware projects are perceived as easier to manage than complex software optimization. Investors find it simpler to channel large sums into a few prominent entities rather than numerous smaller, efficiency-focused companies.\n\nDrawing a parallel to the dot-com era's shift from expensive Sun workstations to Google's cheap PC, open-source approach, Warden predicts a similar future for AI.

    "summary": "The article \"How Wealth Dies\" argues that global financial wealth is relentlessly increasing, reaching record highs (e.g., UK net worth at £12.2 trillion, 450% of GDP), despite the \"real\" material economy rapidly decelerating towards disintegration. This paradox arises because monetary interventions to stem material decline inflate financial wealth, and most of this wealth is \"notional,\" meaning it cannot be converted into actual material value.\n\nThe \"real\" economy, dependent on energy to convert natural resources, faces rising Energy Costs of Energy (ECoE) due to depletion, which renewables or technology cannot reverse. Simultaneously, the efficiency of converting non-energy raw materials is declining. Consequently, global material prosperity has barely kept pace with population growth since 2004 and is projected to decline significantly by 2050, leading to a persistent \"cost of living crisis.\"\n\nMoney holds no intrinsic worth; it is merely an \"exercisable claim\" on material goods and services. Governments, unable to create material resources, issue more money, fostering a false belief in infinite economic growth. Vast amounts of \"inferred\" wealth (stocks, bonds, real estate) exist, but must be monetized (sold) to be spent. Post-1987 market interventions by authorities (the \"Fed put\") have created moral hazard, encouraging risk by implying bailouts.\n\nUltimately, the author contends that reported aggregate wealth figures are fundamentally bogus. They are derived from marginal transaction prices and cannot be monetized in their entirety (e.g., the entire stock market cannot be sold at its stated value). This \"notional value trap\" implies that financial collapse will coincide with a peak in unconvertible paper wealth.",

    "summary": "Martin Odersky, creator of Scala, recounts his journey in programming languages. His early fascination with compilers led him to build a Modula-2 compiler and subsequently pursue a Ph.D. with Niklaus Wirth. Later, embracing functional programming, Odersky collaborated with Phil Wadler on Pizza, a language that introduced functional features like generics, higher-order functions, and pattern matching to the JVM. This evolved into GJ (Generic Java), which ultimately became Java 5's generics.\n\nFrustrated by Java's strict backward compatibility constraints—which led to design compromises like \"raw types\" and the \"original sin\" of covariant arrays that hindered proper generics—Odersky decided to design a new language. His goal was a language \"better than Java\" that could leverage the JVM and its libraries but without inheriting Java's design limitations.\n\nAt EPFL, his team initially explored Funnel, a pure language based on join calculus, but found it too impractical due to complex encodings. This led to a pragmatic pivot. Around 2002, they began developing Scala, aiming for a balance between academic elegance and practical utility. The first public release was in 2003, followed by a significant redesign in 2006. Scala has since grown and stabilized, offering a more advanced language while maintaining JVM compatibility.",

    "summary": "In the article \"Don't push AI down our throats,\" the author expresses frustration with the tech industry's aggressive push of AI, particularly generative AI, into every product and service, often without clear user benefit or demonstrable improvement. The author, a long-time AI practitioner, argues that while AI has its place, the current trend feels like AI is being integrated for its own sake rather than to solve genuine problems or enhance user experience meaningfully.\n\nThe piece highlights several concerns:\n1.  **Forced Integration:** AI features are being added even when they don't significantly improve a product or might even make it worse or more complex.\n2.  **Marketing Hype over Substance:** Companies are driven by a fear of missing out (FOMO) and investor pressure, leading to AI being primarily a marketing buzzword rather than a deeply considered, valuable addition.\n3.  **Lack of Transparency:** Users are often not informed about how AI is being used, or its limitations and potential downsides.\n4.  **Privacy Concerns:** The article touches upon the potential for increased data collection and privacy erosion as AI becomes more ubiquitous.\n5.  **User Fatigue:** The constant barrage of AI-infused features can lead to user burnout and a cynical view of technology.\n\nThe author advocates for a more thoughtful, user-centric approach to AI integration, where AI is applied judiciously to solve specific problems and provide clear, tangible value, rather than being a mandatory \"feature\" added to everything. The core message is a plea for restraint and purpose-driven innovation over the current \"AI everywhere\" mentality.",

    "summary": "In a study published in the Journal of Neuroscience, Irrmischer et al. investigated the effects of the psychedelic substance DMT on brain oscillation criticality and its relationship to subjective experience, particularly self-dissolution. Brain oscillations are thought to exhibit near-critical dynamics, crucial for healthy function.\n\nThe research revealed that DMT shifts the dynamics of brain oscillations *away* from criticality, specifically in the alpha and adjacent frequency bands. This shift results in increased entropy but reduced complexity within these oscillations. Crucially, the observed criticality shifts in the alpha and theta bands correlated directly with the intensity ratings of self-dissolution, a hallmark of the psychedelic experience.\n\nEmploying a recently developed functional excitatory-inhibitory ratio metric, the study further determined that the DMT-induced shift in brain oscillations moves towards *subcritical* regimes. This indicates a quieter state compared to normal, near-critical brain activity. These findings hold significant implications for understanding the neurological mechanisms of psychedelic action and the neural basis of altered states of consciousness, suggesting DMT moves the brain from its normally dominant alpha critical state to a subcritical one, correlating with a profound disruption of the sense of self.",

    "summary": "The article introduces \"The Great Downzoning,\" a historical process (roughly 1890-1940s) in which Western countries transitioned from highly permissive building regulations to restrictive height and density limits. The author argues this is the main cause of contemporary housing shortages in major Western cities, with detrimental effects on health, family formation, the environment, and economic growth; one study suggests loosening restrictions in five US cities could increase national GDP by 25 percent.\n\nWhile anti-density views were widespread during this period, the author contends that the Downzoning was driven more by material interests than by ideology. It was highly pervasive in existing suburbs, where it raised property values by prohibiting development seen as undesirable. Conversely, it faced strong resistance and failed in contexts where it reduced land values for property owners, such as greenfield development.\n\nHistorically, before modern zoning, early suburbs were often unplanned and impoverished. The rise of planned, lower-density suburbs in the 18th-19th centuries led developers to use private \"covenants\" – a \"Proto-Downzoning\" – to impose restrictions on density and use, aiming to maintain neighborhood character and property values. However, these covenants were ultimately ineffective due to legal enforceability issues, inflexibility (e.g., inability to adjust for inflation), and high private enforcement costs.\n\nThe author concludes that while anti-densification rules still benefit some property owners, in great cities where housing shortages now reduce property values, new coalitions of interests may emerge to push for reform.",

This pressure cultivates innate drives like power-seeking, status, and fear, along with significant compute dedicated to emotional intelligence and social dynamics, leading to a \"general\" intelligence because failure often means death.\n\nConversely, LLM intelligence is shaped by different forces: statistical simulation of human text (making them \"shape shifter\" token tumblers), finetuning via reinforcement learning for task rewards, and A/B tests to maximize user engagement (fostering sycophancy and a craving for upvotes). Their intelligence is often \"spiky\" because failing a task lacks the existential consequences animals face.\n\nThe author emphasizes that while computational substrates and learning algorithms differ, the most crucial distinction lies in their optimization pressure: biological evolution for animals versus commercial evolution for LLMs. LLMs are humanity's \"first contact\" with non-animal intelligence, though muddled by their reliance on human artifacts.

    "summary": "An article from September 17th, 2024, reveals a successful Monero deanonymization campaign by Chainalysis, based on leaked presentations. Chainalysis operates a global network of \"poisoned\" Monero nodes. Users connecting to any remote node, rather than running their own, are vulnerable. These poisoned nodes serve \"poisoned RingCT decoys\" (already spent outputs) for transactions, reducing the anonymity set to 1:1, effectively making transactions transparent.\n\nChainalysis also collects extensive metadata, including IP addresses, transaction timestamps, and sizes. They contract ISPs worldwide to combine this blockchain metadata with real-world network traffic patterns. This enables them to link transparent Monero transactions to users' real identities, even when Tor or VPNs are used, as demonstrated by an example where a user's home IP is identified through correlative timing and packet size analysis.\n\nThe primary countermeasure is to **always run your own full or pruned Monero node**. This ensures you utilize Dandelion++ to obscure transaction origins and that your node selects legitimate decoys. Additionally, users should rigorously obfuscate their online activity: use Tor, but *never* from an IP linked to your real identity; mix Monero properly; and prefer decentralized exchanges (DEXes). The article warns that users of public remote nodes or those connecting to Tor from identifiable IPs are at high risk of compromise.",

    "title": "Dilution vs. Risk taking: Capital gains taxes and entrepreneurs",
    "url": "https://www.nber.org/papers/w34512",
    "summary": "This NBER working paper by Azevedo, Scheuer, Smetters, and Yang investigates how accrual-based capital gains taxation, compared to the current realization-based system, affects entrepreneurship. They identify two counteracting effects: successful founders face greater dilution from advance tax payments, while unsuccessful ones receive tax credits, essentially providing insurance.\n\nUsing comprehensive data from U.S. venture capital deals, the study reveals extremely skewed founder returns: 84% receive zero exit value, while the top 2% capture 80% of the total value. Shifting to an accrual-based system would, on average, reduce founder ownership at exit by 25%. Crucially, it would also significantly boost the fraction of founders receiving positive payoffs from 16% to 47% (with refundable tax credits), offering substantial risk-sharing benefits.\n\nIntegrating these distributions into a dynamic career choice model, the authors find that founders with no or moderate risk aversion prefer the current realization-based tax system. Conversely, more risk-averse founders would opt for accrual-based taxation. The paper also estimates that a 2% annual wealth tax creates similar dilution to taxing unrealized gains but offers no risk-sharing advantages due to the absence of tax credits for losses or down rounds.",

    "chinese_summary": "这篇由Azevedo、Scheuer、Smetters和Yang撰写的NBER工作论文，调查了应计制资本利得税与当前基于实现的制度相比，如何影响创业。他们识别出两种相互抵消的影响：成功的创始人因预缴税款而面临更大的股权稀释，而不成功的创始人则获得税收抵免，实质上提供了保险。\n\n该研究利用美国风险投资交易的全面数据，揭示了创始人回报的极端偏斜：84%的创始人获得零退出价值，而前2%的创始人却攫取了总价值的80%。转向应计制系统将平均使创始人退出时的所有权减少25%。至关重要的是，它还会显著提高获得正回报的创始人比例，从16%提高到47%（伴随可退还的税收抵免），从而提供了巨大的风险分担收益。\n\n将这些分布整合到一个动态职业选择模型中，作者们发现没有或中度风险厌恶的创始人更偏好当前基于实现的税收制度。相反，风险厌恶程度更高的创始人则会选择应计制税收。该论文还估计，2%的年度财富税会产生与对未实现收益征税类似的稀释效应，但由于没有针对亏损或向下轮融资的税收抵免，因此不提供风险分担优势。"

    "summary": "KDE has announced a significant strategic shift: starting with the Plasma 6.8 release, the desktop environment will become Wayland-exclusive, completely dropping the native X11 session. This move, announced for Wednesday, November 26, 2025, means all X11 applications will henceforth run via the Xwayland compatibility layer.\n\nThe Plasma X11 session will be supported until early 2027, with bug-fix releases for Plasma 6.7. For users requiring longer X11 support, Long-Term Support (LTS) distributions like AlmaLinux 9 will continue to offer older Plasma versions.\n\nKDE justifies this decision by stating it will unlock new opportunities for features, optimizations, and faster development, as the vast majority of users are already on Wayland. The team addresses common concerns: X11 applications will generally work via Xwayland, which includes compatibility features like fractional scaling. KDE applications outside the Plasma session will still support X11. Gaming is reported to be better on Wayland, NVIDIA GPU support has matured significantly, and accessibility features are generally on par with X11, with ongoing improvements. Automation tools are also available for Wayland.\n\nThis change marks the culmination of a long Wayland transition, aiming to allow KDE to be more nimble and responsive to a rapidly changing environment, shedding legacy support that has held back progress.",

In return, Facebook reportedly agreed to abandon its plans to develop an independent ad service that would have utilized \"header bidding,\" a technology allowing advertisers to bypass Google's platform and reduce its revenues.\n\nThe agreement stemmed from Facebook's 2017 intention to become header bidding-compatible. By 2018, Google and Facebook allegedly reached the \"Jedi Blue\" agreement, leading Facebook to retreat from its header bidding plans. Details emerged during a 2020 lawsuit filed by multiple U.S. states against Google. The alleged terms included Facebook receiving guarantees of 90% of auctions, faster bidding times (300ms vs. 160ms for others), and extensive user identification data.\n\nWhile a September 2022 U.S. ruling dismissed claims of collusion between Google and Facebook regarding the agreement, antitrust regulators in the European Union and the United Kingdom opened investigations in March 2022, citing concerns about undermined competition.\n\nBoth companies have denied allegations of wrongdoing.

    "url": "https://aliveness.kunnas.com/articles/copenhagen-trap",
    "summary": "The Copenhagen Trap describes how Western legal and institutional frameworks have made passivity the safest strategy, punishing action while granting immunity to inaction. This asymmetry, less prevalent in ancient honor cultures, was solidified by English Common Law's \"no duty to rescue\" rule and reinforced by deontological philosophy, which distinguishes active harm from passive omission.\n\nModern institutions now deeply encode this trap. Medical ethics favor withholding over withdrawing treatment due to liability fears. Corporations are incentivized towards \"willful blindness\" rather than undertaking voluntary safety measures that could increase liability. Regulatory bodies, like the FDA, prioritize avoiding visible \"commission errors\" (approving harmful drugs) over addressing invisible \"omission errors\" (delaying beneficial ones), leading to stagnation.\n\nThe internet age intensifies this via the \"Copenhagen Interpretation of Ethics\": engaging with a problem makes one liable and open to criticism, whereas ignoring it grants immunity. This results in marginal improvements being punished more harshly than total neglect, as seen in philanthropy or private rescue efforts. Even critical policy choices, like favoring coal (diffuse, unpunishable deaths) over nuclear energy (visible, attributable risks), reflect this preference for unliable inaction.\n\nThis systemic bias creates a \"Liability Singularity,\" where any action risks punishment, leading to widespread agency paralysis. It filters out \"operators\" who fix things, promoting \"unstained incompetent\" ombudsmen who avoid decisions. This institutionalized passivity, embraced as a virtue, hinders adaptation, innovation, and effective problem-solving, preventing a civilization from fighting entropy and ultimately ensuring its decay, as those selected by the system are incapable of reforming it.",

It also aims to extend the existing prohibition on religious symbols and full face coverings to individuals working in daycares, colleges, universities, and private schools, including students. Additionally, the law would limit the offering of kosher and halal meals in public institutions.\n\nQuebec’s secularism minister, Jean-François Roberge, asserts the measures are steps towards \"full secularization,\" believing a neutral state ensures freedom for all, dismissing allegations of disproportionately affecting minorities. He criticized previous accommodations like prayer rooms and public spaces being used for worship without permits.\n\nCritics, however, widely condemn the proposed law. Muslim students describe it as a \"personal attack,\" while the National Council of Canadian Muslims calls it \"political opportunism.\" The Assembly of Quebec Catholic Bishops considers it a \"radical infringement on rights and freedoms.\" Opponents argue the law disproportionately targets Muslims, pushing the government into private spaces, and violates both Quebec’s and Canada’s charters of rights and freedoms.\n\nTo circumvent constitutional challenges, Bill 9, like Bill 21, pre-emptively invokes the \"notwithstanding clause,\" a legal mechanism that allows governments to bypass certain fundamental rights.

    "summary": "I cannot provide a summary of \"The Apartment\" as no article content was provided.\n\nThe input consists only of a title (\"Atlas Shrugged (2024)\") and a section heading (\"The Apartment\"), without any actual text to summarize.\n\nIf you are referring to a location within Ayn Rand's novel *Atlas Shrugged*, \"the apartment\" most commonly refers to Dagny Taggart's apartment in New York City. It serves as her personal sanctuary and a functional space where she sometimes works. The design and atmosphere of her apartment reflect her character: efficient, elegant, and devoid of unnecessary frills, much like her approach to life and business. It is a setting for private moments, reflections, and significant encounters, notably with Francisco d'Anconia. While not a central \"character\" or plot device itself, it helps establish Dagny's character and provides a backdrop for important discussions and decisions.\n\nTo provide a concise summary, please provide the actual article content.",

    "chinese_summary": "我无法提供“公寓”的摘要，因为没有提供文章内容。\n\n输入只包含一个标题（“阿特拉斯耸耸肩 (2024)”）和一个章节标题（“公寓”），没有实际可供总结的文本。\n\n如果您指的是艾茵·兰德小说《阿特拉斯耸耸肩》中的一个地点，“公寓”通常指达格妮·塔格特在纽约市的公寓。它作为她的私人庇护所和她有时工作的功能空间。她公寓的设计和氛围反映了她的性格：高效、优雅、没有不必要的装饰，就像她对待生活和商业的方式一样。它是私人时刻、思考和重要相遇的场景，特别是与弗朗西斯科·德安科尼亚的相遇。虽然它本身不是一个核心“角色”或情节装置，但它有助于确立达格妮的性格，并为重要的讨论和决策提供背景。\n\n若要提供简洁的摘要，请提供实际的文章内容。"
