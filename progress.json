    "title": "How to code Claude Code in 200 lines of code",
    "url": "https://www.mihaileric.com/The-Emperor-Has-No-Clothes/",
    "summary": "This article demonstrates how to build a functional AI coding agent, similar to Claude Code, in approximately 200 lines of Python. The author argues that the \"magic\" of these tools lies in a straightforward conversational loop between a powerful Large Language Model (LLM) and a set of local tools.\n\nThe mental model involves:\n1.  You send a message to the LLM.\n2.  The LLM decides to use a tool and responds with a structured tool call.\n3.  Your program executes the tool locally.\n4.  The result is sent back to the LLM as context.\n5.  The LLM continues or responds.\n\nThe core agent requires three fundamental tools:\n*   `read_file_tool`: To get file content.\n*   `list_files_tool`: To navigate directories.\n*   `edit_file_tool`: To create or modify files (replacing text or creating new files if `old_str` is empty).\n\nThese tools are registered in a `TOOL_REGISTRY`. A crucial step is teaching the LLM about these tools by generating a dynamic system prompt that includes each tool's name, description (from docstrings), and signature. This prompt also specifies the exact format the LLM must use to invoke a tool (`tool: TOOL_NAME({JSON_ARGS})`).\n\nThe agent's main loop:\n1.  Takes user input.\n2.  Calls the LLM with the conversation history and system prompt.\n3.  Parses the LLM's response to identify `tool:` invocations.\n4.  If tools are invoked, it executes them, sends the `tool_result(...)` back to the LLM, and repeats the inner loop until the LLM responds without requesting tools.\n5.  If no tools are invoked, the LLM's response is printed, and the outer loop awaits new user input.\n\nWhile production agents add features like error handling, streaming, and more tools, the underlying architecture of an LLM deciding what to do, your code executing it, and results flowing back, remains the same. The article encourages readers to build and expand upon this simple, yet powerful, pattern.",
    "chinese_title": "如何用200行代码编写克劳德代码",
    "chinese_summary": "本文演示了如何用大约200行Python代码构建一个功能性AI编程代理，类似于Claude Code。作者认为，这些工具的“魔力”在于强大的大型语言模型（LLM）与一套本地工具之间直接的对话循环。\n\n这种思维模型包括：\n1.  你向LLM发送一条消息。\n2.  LLM决定使用一个工具，并以结构化的工具调用形式响应。\n3.  你的程序在本地执行该工具。\n4.  结果作为上下文发送回LLM。\n5.  LLM继续处理或作出响应。\n\n核心代理需要三个基本工具：\n*   `read_file_tool`：用于获取文件内容。\n*   `list_files_tool`：用于导航目录。\n*   `edit_file_tool`：用于创建或修改文件（替换文本，或在`old_str`为空时创建新文件）。\n\n这些工具注册在一个`TOOL_REGISTRY`中。关键一步是通过生成一个动态系统提示来教会LLM这些工具，该提示包含每个工具的名称、描述（来自文档字符串）和签名。这个提示还指定了LLM调用工具时必须使用的确切格式 (`tool: TOOL_NAME({JSON_ARGS})`)。\n\n代理的主循环：\n1.  接收用户输入。\n2.  使用对话历史和系统提示调用LLM。\n3.  解析LLM的响应以识别`tool:`调用。\n4.  如果调用了工具，则执行它们，将`tool_result(...)`发送回LLM，并重复内部循环，直到LLM响应时不请求工具。\n5.  如果没有调用工具，则打印LLM的响应，并且外部循环等待新的用户输入。\n\n尽管生产级代理会增加错误处理、流式传输和更多工具等功能，但LLM决定做什么、你的代码执行它以及结果回流的底层架构保持不变。本文鼓励读者在此简单而强大的模式基础上进行构建和扩展。"

This technology offers a promising lower-carbon alternative for consumer electronics, designed to be rechargeable, non-toxic, non-flammable, and non-explosive.\n\nFlint's proprietary batteries use cellulose paper at their core for all key components, remaining operational even when damaged and integrating easily with existing manufacturing processes. The purpose-built production line in Singapore utilizes water-based methods, aiming to reduce reliance on traditional battery materials like lithium, nickel, cobalt, and lead, and enabling improved end-of-life options.\n\nThis production milestone follows a successful 2025 for Flint, which included winning the Best of CES Sustainability Award at CES 2025. The company has since expanded its commercial pipeline, secured US$2 million in funding, and initiated pilot programs with global brands like Logitech, while also collaborating with MIT's Climate Tech Accelerator.\n\nFlint will formally unveil its first two commercial paper battery products with live demonstrations at CES 2026. Beyond Singapore, the company is preparing for further expansion into Europe and is developing a solid-state derivative of its chemistry for higher-density applications. Initial battery allocations will prioritize pilot deployments and early commercial rollouts with strategic partners.",
