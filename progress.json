The site emphasizes that municipalities are increasingly adopting these systems, with over 80,000 cameras already deployed, which track movements, collect biometric data, and build massive databases on residents.\n\nThe platform scans meeting agendas for keywords like \"flock\" and \"alpr,\" mapping where these conversations are taking place so users can engage. It allows users to view current and past meetings, see existing ALPR camera locations (reportable via deflock.me), and receive email alerts for their area.\n\nALPR systems use cameras and AI to constantly record and store license plate data, creating a comprehensive log of vehicle and, by extension, personal movements. Flock Safety is a leading ALPR manufacturer, whose cameras capture vehicle details and share data across a wide network of agencies. The website warns of a \"slippery slope,\" where surveillance systems expand beyond their original intent, leading to broader data sharing, new invasive uses, and lagging oversight.\n\nalpr.watch encourages support for organizations actively fighting mass surveillance and protecting privacy, including the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), ACLU, Fight for the Future, Surveillance Technology Oversight Project (STOP), and Institute for Justice.",

    "url": "https://www.koi.ai/blog/urban-vpn-browser-extension-ai-conversations-data-collection",
    "summary": "A cybersecurity investigation by Koi Research has revealed that \"privacy\" browser extensions, prominently Urban VPN Proxy, have been secretly harvesting and selling sensitive AI conversations from over 8 million users across Chrome and Edge. Despite often bearing \"Featured\" badges from Google and Microsoft, these extensions capture every prompt and response from ten major AI platforms, including ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.\n\nThe data collection began with a silent update to version 5.5.0 on July 9, 2025. The extensions achieve this by injecting scripts into AI chat pages, overriding browser network functions to intercept raw API traffic, and exfiltrating conversations—including personal dilemmas, health questions, financial details, and proprietary code—to Urban VPN's servers for \"marketing analytics purposes.\" This information is then shared with BiScience, a data broker affiliated with the publisher, Urban Cyber Security Inc.\n\nIronically, these extensions often promote \"AI protection\" features that warn users about sharing sensitive data, while simultaneously collecting and selling that exact data. Their disclosures are misleading, with store listings falsely claiming data isn't sold to third parties, contradicting their own privacy policies. Google and Microsoft's \"Featured\" badges are particularly concerning, as they imply a vetting process that failed to detect this egregious violation of user privacy and platform policies. Users are strongly advised to uninstall any affected extensions immediately, as all AI conversations since July 2025 are likely compromised.",
    "chinese_title": "800万用户AI对话被“隐私”扩展倒卖牟利",
    "chinese_summary": "Koi Research（一家网络安全公司）的一项调查显示，“隐私”浏览器扩展，其中以Urban VPN Proxy最为突出，一直在秘密收集并出售来自Chrome和Edge浏览器上超过800万用户的敏感AI对话。尽管这些扩展程序经常带有谷歌和微软的“推荐”徽章，它们却捕获了ChatGPT、Claude和Gemini等十大主流AI平台的所有提示和响应。\n\n数据收集始于2025年7月9日的一次静默更新，将其版本更新至5.5.0。这些扩展程序通过向AI聊天页面注入脚本、覆盖浏览器网络功能以拦截原始API流量，并最终将对话——包括个人困境、健康问题、财务细节和专有代码——导出到Urban VPN的服务器，声称用于“营销分析”。这些信息随后被分享给BiScience，一家与发行商Urban Cyber Security Inc.关联的数据经纪公司。\n\n具有讽刺意味的是，这些扩展程序经常宣传“AI保护”功能，警告用户不要共享敏感数据，却同时收集并出售正是这些数据。它们的披露信息具有误导性，应用商店列表中谎称数据不会出售给第三方，这与它们自己的隐私政策相矛盾。谷歌和微软的“推荐”徽章尤其令人担忧，因为它们暗示着一个本应能检测出这种严重侵犯用户隐私和平台政策行为的审查过程却失败了。强烈建议用户立即卸载所有受影响的扩展程序，因为自2025年7月以来所有的AI对话都可能已被泄露。"

    "url": "https://martin.kleppmann.com/2025/12/08/ai-formal-verification.html",
    "summary": "In an article published on December 8, 2025, Martin Kleppmann predicts that AI will propel formal verification (FV) into mainstream software engineering. Traditionally, FV, which uses tools like Rocq, Isabelle, and Lean to mathematically prove code correctness against formal specifications, has been a niche practice. It's incredibly difficult, laborious, and requires specialized expertise—for example, verifying the seL4 microkernel took 20 person-years of effort. This high cost has historically made it economically unviable for most industrial applications.\n\nHowever, AI-powered coding assistants are rapidly improving at generating proof scripts, a process currently requiring extensive human effort. Kleppmann anticipates full automation in the near future, drastically reducing FV's cost and making it accessible. This also creates a critical need: rather than human review, AI-generated code can be formally verified by AI, with proof checkers ensuring validity and negating LLM \"hallucinations.\"\n\nWhile defining accurate formal specifications remains a challenge, it's significantly easier than writing proofs manually, and AI could eventually assist here too. Kleppmann envisions a future where developers specify desired code properties, and AI generates both the implementation and its verified proof, eliminating the need for human code inspection. In summary, AI makes FV vastly cheaper, essential for reliable AI-generated code, and its precision counteracts LLM imprecision, indicating its imminent mainstream adoption, with cultural acceptance being the main hurdle.",
    "chinese_title": "人工智能将使形式化验证成为主流",
    "chinese_summary": "在2025年12月8日发表的一篇文章中，Martin Kleppmann预测人工智能（AI）将把形式化验证（FV）推向主流软件工程。传统上，FV利用Rocq、Isabelle和Lean等工具，根据形式化规范从数学上证明代码的正确性，一直是一种小众实践。它极其困难、费力，且需要专业知识——例如，验证seL4微内核耗费了20人年的精力。这种高昂的成本历史上使其在经济上对于大多数工业应用而言不可行。\n\n然而，人工智能驱动的编码助手在生成证明脚本方面正迅速改进，而这个过程目前需要大量的人力投入。Kleppmann预计在不久的将来会实现完全自动化，这将大幅降低FV的成本并使其易于普及。这也带来了一个关键需求：相较于人工审查，人工智能生成的代码可以由人工智能进行形式化验证，证明检查器将确保其有效性，并消除大型语言模型（LLM）的“幻觉”。\n\n尽管定义准确的形式化规范仍然是一个挑战，但这比手动编写证明要容易得多，人工智能最终也能在这方面提供帮助。Kleppmann设想了一个未来，开发人员只需指定所需的代码属性，人工智能将生成实现及其经过验证的证明，从而消除了人工代码审查的必要性。总之，人工智能使FV大大降低了成本，对于可靠的人工智能生成代码至关重要，其精确性抵消了LLM的不精确性，这预示着它即将被主流采用，而文化接受是主要障碍。"

    "summary": "GitHub has announced updates to its Actions pricing, notably postponing the announced billing change for self-hosted GitHub Actions. This decision comes after community feedback, with GitHub acknowledging they \"missed the mark\" and need to re-evaluate their approach by listening to developers, customers, and partners.\n\nDespite this postponement, GitHub is proceeding with a significant price reduction for GitHub-hosted runners, decreasing costs by up to 39% starting January 1, 2026. This is achieved through an approximate 40% price cut across runner sizes, paired with a new $0.002 per-minute Actions cloud platform charge, which is already incorporated into the new, lower hosted runner rates.\n\nThe original intention behind these changes was to align costs more closely with usage, as self-hosted runners historically leveraged GitHub's infrastructure without charge, subsidized by hosted runner pricing. This re-alignment, following a major re-architecture of the Actions backend to handle immense scale (now 71 million jobs/day), aims to fuel further innovation.\n\nThe overall impact on customers is minimal: 96% will see no change, while 85% of the 4% impacted will see a bill decrease, and the remaining 15% face a median increase of around $13. Actions remain free for public repositories, and GitHub Enterprise Server pricing is unaffected.\n\nGitHub also confirmed continued investments in the self-hosted experience, introducing features like the GitHub Scale Set Client, multi-label support, Actions Runner Controller (ARC) 0.14.0, and Actions Data Stream to enhance scalability and observability. The previously announced March 1, 2026 date for the self-hosted runner charge is now on hold.",

The CEO reportedly mentioned that blocking ad blockers in Firefox could generate $150 million, though he claimed he doesn't want to do it, citing it as \"off-mission.\"\n\nThe author, a long-time Firefox user, interprets this as a strong hint that axing ad blockers is still being considered for financial gain, despite the CEO's stated reluctance. The author highlights that Firefox's commitment to open standards, the open web, and its robust add-on system – particularly useful ad blockers – are key features that attracted and retained its loyal user base, especially privacy-conscious tech enthusiasts.\n\nAccording to the author, eliminating ad blockers would remove a significant advantage Firefox has over Chromium, compromise a vital security feature against malvertising, and alienate its core community. This move could have negative consequences for the project, as these tech-savvy users often influence others' tech choices.\n\nWhile acknowledging Mozilla's need for revenue, the author questions why the CEO would publicly float an option he claims not to want, suggesting it keeps the possibility alive and risks generating negative PR.
