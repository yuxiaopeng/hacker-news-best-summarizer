    "url": "https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/28/patreon-apple-tax/",
    "summary": "Apple is mandating that all Patreon creators use its App Store's in-app purchase system for payments made through the Patreon iOS app, with a new deadline of November 1, 2026. This policy will result in Apple taking a 30% commission from these creator payments, a rate that drops to 15% for subscriptions active for over a year. Apple justifies this by categorizing supporter payments to creators as digital goods, making them subject to its commission structure.\n\nPatreon, a platform facilitating fan payments to creators, has voiced its disappointment regarding Apple's policy. Creators are presented with two options: either increase their prices specifically within the iOS app to cover Apple's fee or absorb the fee themselves to maintain uniform pricing across all platforms. iOS users, however, can circumvent Apple's commission by completing their payments directly through Patreon's website.\n\nThis requirement, which was initially slated for November 2025 before being extended, primarily impacts a small segment of Patreon creators. TechCrunch reports that 96% of creators have already transitioned from Patreon's legacy billing system to Apple's in-app purchase system, leaving only 4% still to switch. Patreon has provided an FAQ to offer creators more detailed information on these changes.",
    "chinese_title": "苹果即将向iOS应用内的所有Patreon创作者抽取高达30%的分成",
    "chinese_summary": "Apple 强制要求所有 Patreon 创作者使用其 App Store 的应用内购买系统，处理通过 Patreon iOS 应用进行的支付，新截止日期为 2026 年 11 月 1 日。这项政策将导致苹果从这些创作者支付中抽取 30% 的佣金，对于活跃超过一年的订阅，佣金率降至 15%。苹果将支持者向创作者支付的款项归类为数字商品，使其受制于其佣金结构，以此来为这项政策辩护。\n\nPatreon 作为一个促进粉丝向创作者付费的平台，对苹果的政策表示失望。创作者面临两种选择：要么专门在 iOS 应用内提高价格以覆盖苹果的费用，要么自行承担费用以在所有平台保持统一价格。然而，iOS 用户可以通过直接在 Patreon 网站上完成支付来规避苹果的佣金。\n\n这项要求最初定于 2025 年 11 月实施，后被延期，主要影响一小部分 Patreon 创作者。据 TechCrunch 报道，96% 的创作者已经从 Patreon 的旧有计费系统过渡到苹果的应用内购买系统，只剩下 4% 尚未切换。Patreon 已提供常见问题解答，为创作者提供有关这些变化的更详细信息。"

Updated daily using a curated subset of SWE-Bench-Pro, the tracker benchmarks directly within the Claude Code CLI with the SOTA model (Opus 4.5) to mirror actual user experience.\n\nAs of January 30, 2026, the tracker indicates \"Degradation detected over past 30 days.\" The historical baseline pass rate is 58%. Current performance stands at a 56% daily pass rate (50 evaluations), 54% over the last 7 days (250 evaluations), and 54% over the last 30 days (705 evaluations).\n\nWhile daily (-2.0%) and 7-day (-4.4%) performance drops are not statistically significant against their respective thresholds (±14.0% and ±5.6%), the -4.0% drop over the last 30 days *is* statistically significant, surpassing its ±3.2% threshold.\n\nThe independent third-party methodology involves daily evaluations of 50 tasks, aggregated for weekly and monthly trends. Statistical significance (p < 0.05) is determined using Bernoulli random variables and 95% confidence intervals, providing an early warning system for performance drops, inspired by past Claude degradations.

The author dismisses concerns about AI scamming the elderly, creating non-consensual explicit images, causing job displacement, and ecological damage as simplistic thinking. They sarcastically tout AI as \"the most essential tool ever created\" that will \"solve all problems of feminism and equal rights,\" immediately contradicting these claims by acknowledging it expands surveillance, destroys education, uses copyrighted work without permission, and fuels lethal autonomous weapons.\n\nUltimately, the article's persona—a self-proclaimed \"immoral technofascist\"—directly asks readers to \"just use my evil technology\" so they can continue their lifestyle without criticism. The piece highlights a cynical perspective on the motivations behind some AI advocacy, suggesting a disregard for societal harm in pursuit of profit and unchecked power.",

Genie 3 simulates world dynamics, generating real-time paths as users move and interact, complete with simulated physics.\n\nThe prototype centers on three core capabilities:\n1.  **World Sketching:** Users craft environments, characters, and exploration methods (e.g., walking, flying) using text prompts and images, with Nano Banana Pro aiding in fine-tuning and perspective setting.\n2.  **World Exploration:** Users can navigate these dynamic environments, with the system generating new paths in real-time based on their actions.\n3.  **World Remixing:** Users can modify existing worlds, draw inspiration from a curated gallery, and download videos of their explorations.\n\nAs an early-stage experimental project from Google Labs, Project Genie has known limitations, including variable realism, occasional deviations from physics or prompts, less controllable characters, and a 60-second generation limit. Some advanced Genie 3 features are yet to be integrated.\n\nGoogle aims to gather user feedback to advance AI research and generative media, with plans to expand access to Project Genie and its underlying world-building technology to more users globally in the future.",
