    "summary": "The article highlights an observation made by a user named Héliographe on Mastodon. The core idea is that if one were to view Apple's icon designs in reverse chronological order, it would create the distinct impression of a designer progressively improving their skills. This suggests a humorous or insightful commentary on the perceived evolution of Apple's design aesthetics over time.",

    "summary": "jQuery 4.0.0 was released on January 17, 2026, marking the JavaScript library's 20th anniversary and its first major version update in nearly a decade. This release brings significant modernizations and improvements, along with several breaking changes. An upgrade guide and jQuery Migrate plugin are available to aid transition.\n\nKey changes include the removal of support for IE 10 and older (IE 11 support will be dropped in jQuery 5.0), Edge Legacy, and very old versions of iOS, Firefox, and Android Browser. jQuery 4.0 adds support for Trusted Types and Content Security Policy (CSP), with most asynchronous script requests now using `<script>` tags to avoid CSP errors.\n\nThe jQuery source has been migrated from AMD to ES modules, enhancing compatibility with modern build tools. Numerous long-deprecated APIs like `jQuery.isArray`, `jQuery.parseJSON`, and `jQuery.trim` have been removed, with native JavaScript equivalents recommended. Internal-only `push`, `sort`, and `splice` methods were also removed from the jQuery prototype.\n\nA breaking change in behavior is the focus event order, which now follows the W3C specification, diverging from jQuery's previous consistent order. The \"slim\" build is even smaller, excluding Deferreds and Callbacks in favor of native Promises (requiring the main build or a polyfill for IE11). Overall, the release achieves a size reduction of over 3k bytes gzipped.\n\njQuery 4.0.0 is available on the jQuery CDN and npm.",
    "chinese_title": "jQuery 4",
    "chinese_summary": "jQuery 4.0.0 于 2026 年 1 月 17 日发布，标志着这个 JavaScript 库的 20 周年，也是其近十年来首次主要版本更新。此次发布带来了显著的现代化和改进，同时伴随着一些破坏性变更。提供了升级指南和 jQuery Migrate 插件以帮助过渡。\n\n主要变更包括移除对 IE 10 及更早版本（IE 11 支持将在 jQuery 5.0 中移除）、Edge Legacy 以及非常旧的 iOS、Firefox 和 Android Browser 版本的支持。jQuery 4.0 新增了对 Trusted Types 和内容安全策略 (CSP) 的支持，现在大多数异步脚本请求都使用 `<script>` 标签以避免 CSP 错误。\n\njQuery 源代码已从 AMD 迁移到 ES 模块，增强了与现代构建工具的兼容性。许多长期弃用的 API，如 `jQuery.isArray`、`jQuery.parseJSON` 和 `jQuery.trim` 已被移除，推荐使用原生 JavaScript 的等效方法。内部专用的 `push`、`sort` 和 `splice` 方法也已从 jQuery 原型中移除。\n\n一个行为上的破坏性变更是焦点事件的顺序，现在它遵循 W3C 规范，与 jQuery 之前保持一致的顺序有所不同。\"slim\" 构建变得更小，移除了 Deferreds 和 Callbacks，转而支持原生 Promises（IE11 需要主构建版本或 polyfill）。总的来说，该版本实现了超过 3k 字节（gzip 压缩后）的体积减小。\n\njQuery 4.0.0 可通过 jQuery CDN 和 npm 获取。"

    "summary": "The Kiel Policy Brief, \"America’s Own Goal: Who Pays the Tariffs?\", concludes that American importers and consumers bear almost the entire cost of the 2025 US tariffs. Authors Hinz, Lohmann, Mahlkow, and Vorwig found that a striking 96% of the tariff burden is passed through to US buyers, with foreign exporters absorbing only about 4%.\n\nThis analysis utilizes shipment-level data covering over 25 million transactions valued at nearly $4 trillion, revealing near-complete pass-through of tariffs to US import prices. Consequently, US customs revenue is projected to surge by approximately $200 billion in 2025, a tax predominantly paid by Americans.\n\nEvent studies examining discrete tariff shocks on Brazil (50%) and India (25–50%) further confirm these findings: export prices did not decline. Instead, trade volumes collapsed. Indian export customs data validated this, showing that Indian exporters maintained their prices and reduced shipments when facing US tariffs, rather than absorbing the cost.

    "summary": "The author details an experience on HackerNews where an open-source project's creator, despite clear AI-like phrasing in their comments (e.g., \"you are absolutely right\") and suspicious code characteristics, vehemently denied using AI. This, coupled with the author's evolving stance on AI (now using it but stressing the need for disclosure due to its potential for errors), prompted a reflection on the authenticity of online interactions.\n\nThis led the author to the \"Dead Internet Theory,\" which posits that since around 2016, much of the internet's content and interactions are machine-generated by bots for commercial or SEO purposes. The author contrasts this with their positive early 2000s internet experience (IRC, phpBB forums), where genuine human connections fostered learning. Further examples like AI-generated corporate photos on LinkedIn and widespread \"AI-slop\" on major social networks reinforce the author's sadness and concern. They question the future usefulness of technology if it primarily facilitates bot-to-bot interactions and repackaged, AI-generated content driven by sales, rather than true human connection and knowledge sharing.",

    "summary": "The author strongly refutes recent analyses predicting OpenAI's demise, asserting the company is financially robust with a $260B valuation and $40B funding. Despite a significant burn rate ($8-12B in 2025), OpenAI expects $20B ARR for 2025 and is poised for an IPO.\n\nThe article predicts OpenAI's ad strategy will be a major revenue driver, positioning it as a \"High Intent\" platform akin to Google Search, rather than social media. Confirmed ad products include sponsored content at the bottom of answers, in search, and sidebars, rolling out through 2026 to free and Go tiers in the U.S. Ads will be \"clearly labeled,\" independent of answers, respect privacy, and offer user control. Paid tiers (Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise) will remain ad-free.\n\nOpenAI's strategy includes a self-serve platform, affiliate commissions, and conversational ads. With Fidji Simo (ex-Meta ad monetization lead) as CEO of Applications, the company is expected to build out its full ad stack.\n\nThe author projects a \"Super Bullish Target ARPU Trajectory\": $5.50 in 2026, scaling to $50 by 2029, drawing comparisons to Perplexity's high CPMs. Factoring in conservative user growth and current revenues, total revenue projections are:\n*   **2026:** $30-35B (including ~$5.2B from ads)\n*   **2029:** $140-150B (including ~$70B from ads)\n\nThe piece concludes cynically that \"The World is Ads,\" framing advertising as a necessary evil to achieve AGI and make AI accessible.",
