    "url": "https://www.birdy.chat/blog/first-to-interoperate-with-whatsapp",
    "summary": "On November 14, 2025, BirdyChat announced it has become the first European chat app to achieve interoperability with WhatsApp, leveraging the Digital Markets Act (DMA). This milestone allows BirdyChat users to exchange messages with WhatsApp users, moving closer to BirdyChat's goal of centralizing work conversations.\n\nPreviously, BirdyChat's adoption was limited as users could only message other BirdyChat account holders, requiring new users to download the app. With the new WhatsApp interface mandated by the DMA, any BirdyChat user in the European Economic Area (EEA) can now initiate a 1:1 chat with any WhatsApp user in the region using just their phone number. This removes a significant barrier, allowing BirdyChat users to keep work organized within their app while seamlessly connecting with WhatsApp contacts without asking them to switch platforms.\n\nThe interoperability enables users to send messages, photos, and files over an end-to-end encrypted connection. A notable feature for professionals is the ability to use a work email as an identity, helping to separate work and personal communications. BirdyChat integrates through WhatsApp's official DMA \"Third-Party Chats\" interface.\n\nCurrently, the feature supports 1:1 chats, with group chat interoperability planned for a future update. The rollout will be gradual across the EEA, and both BirdyChat and WhatsApp contacts must be located in the EEA for the functionality to work. BirdyChat is currently invite-only, and users can join a waitlist with their work email for early access.",
    "chinese_title": "BirdyChat 成为首款与 WhatsApp 互通的欧洲聊天应用",
    "chinese_summary": "2025年11月14日，BirdyChat宣布已成为首个利用《数字市场法案》（DMA）实现与WhatsApp互操作的欧洲聊天应用。这一里程碑使得BirdyChat用户能够与WhatsApp用户互发消息，进一步接近BirdyChat集中管理工作对话的目标。\n\n此前，BirdyChat的普及受到限制，因为用户只能与其他BirdyChat账户持有者发送消息，新用户必须下载该应用。随着DMA强制要求的新WhatsApp接口的推出，欧洲经济区（EEA）内的任何BirdyChat用户现在只需使用对方的电话号码，即可在该区域内与任何WhatsApp用户发起一对一聊天。这消除了一个重大障碍，让BirdyChat用户能够在自己的应用内整理工作事务，同时无缝连接WhatsApp联系人，而无需对方切换平台。\n\n互操作性使用户能够通过端到端加密连接发送消息、照片和文件。对于专业人士而言，一个值得关注的特点是能够使用工作邮箱作为身份标识，有助于区分工作和个人通信。BirdyChat通过WhatsApp官方DMA“第三方聊天”接口进行集成。\n\n目前，该功能支持一对一聊天，群聊互操作性计划在未来更新中推出。该功能将在EEA内逐步推广，且BirdyChat和WhatsApp联系人都必须位于EEA内才能使用该功能。BirdyChat目前仅限受邀用户使用，用户可以通过工作邮箱加入候补名单以获取早期访问权限。"

    "summary": "On Saturday, January 24, 2026, federal agents fatally shot Alex Jeffrey Pretti, 37, in south Minneapolis, leading to protests and calls for investigation. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) claimed Pretti was armed with a gun and ammunition, and a Border Patrol agent fired in self-defense. However, these federal claims are unverified and partially contradicted by witness accounts and video evidence. An eyewitness pediatrician noted that agents did not immediately perform CPR or check for a pulse.\n\nThis incident is the second fatal shooting this month involving federal agents in Minnesota, who are engaged in a massive immigration enforcement operation. Following the shooting, Minneapolis residents held vigils, and confrontations occurred between protesters and agents. On Sunday, January 25, roads at the scene re-opened, while a judge ordered the federal government to preserve evidence, and Minnesota investigators began collecting evidence. Officials are pressing for a thorough investigation into the shooting, which has intensified tensions related to the ongoing immigration enforcement surge.",

    "url": "https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/microsoft-bitlocker-encryption-keys-give-fbi-legal-order-privacy-nightmare",
    "summary": "Microsoft has confirmed it will provide the FBI with BitLocker encryption keys for Windows PCs when presented with a valid legal order. This capability arises from Windows 11's default setting, which automatically backs up these encryption keys to a user's Microsoft Account in the cloud, linking them to the online account.\n\nWhile intended for convenient data recovery, this default behavior allows Microsoft access to the keys, making them available to law enforcement. Forbes reported an instance where Microsoft provided keys in early 2025 for an investigation into COVID unemployment fraud in Guam. Microsoft stated that key recovery offers convenience but also carries risks, emphasizing that customers decide how to manage their keys.\n\nMicrosoft reportedly receives about 20 FBI requests for BitLocker keys annually, though most cannot be fulfilled as the keys were never uploaded. This policy stands in stark contrast to Apple, which has notoriously refused law enforcement access to encrypted data, and Meta, which uses zero-knowledge architectures to encrypt keys server-side, making them accessible only to the user.\n\nA significant privacy concern highlighted is that the encryption keys uploaded to Microsoft's cloud are reportedly not encrypted on Microsoft's end, meaning they are available in an unencrypted state. Users are advised to check their Microsoft Account to see if their BitLocker keys are stored in the cloud and to delete them if privacy is a concern.",
    "chinese_title": "微软将根据命令向联邦调查局提供Windows电脑数据加密密钥。",
    "chinese_summary": "微软已证实，在收到有效的法律命令时，它将向联邦调查局提供Windows电脑的BitLocker加密密钥。这一能力源于Windows 11的默认设置，该设置会自动将这些加密密钥备份到用户的微软云账户中，并将它们与在线账户关联起来。\n\n尽管此举旨在方便数据恢复，但这种默认行为允许微软访问这些密钥，从而使其可供执法部门获取。《福布斯》报道称，微软在2025年初为调查关岛的COVID失业欺诈案提供了密钥。微软表示，密钥恢复提供了便利，但也伴随着风险，并强调客户自行决定如何管理他们的密钥。\n\n据报道，微软每年收到约20份联邦调查局索取BitLocker密钥的请求，但大多数请求无法满足，因为密钥从未被上传。这一政策与苹果公司形成了鲜明对比，苹果公司以拒绝执法部门访问加密数据而闻名；与Meta公司也不同，Meta公司采用零知识架构在服务器端加密密钥，使其只有用户才能访问。\n\n一个值得关注的重大隐私问题是，据报道，上传到微软云端的加密密钥在微软端并未加密，这意味着它们以未加密的状态存在。建议用户检查他们的微软账户，查看BitLocker密钥是否存储在云端，如果担心隐私问题，则将其删除。"

They allege that Telekom is throttling internet services by creating artificial bottlenecks at its network access points. The accusation states that services paying Telekom receive fast access, while others are intentionally slowed down or become inaccessible, thus violating net neutrality.\n\nNumerous customer testimonials support these claims, detailing significant performance issues. Users report extremely slow loading times or complete inaccessibility for various websites and services, including those utilizing Cloudflare, Google services, Reddit, YouTube, Discord, GitHub, OpenAI, Canva, DeepL, Notion, and ChatGPT. Academic platforms and public broadcasting media libraries are also frequently affected, especially during peak evening hours, with issues like severe packet loss, low download speeds (sometimes mere kilobytes per second), and poor streaming quality. Many users confirm that these problems resolve when using a VPN or switching to another internet provider, highlighting a selective slowing of traffic. Customers express deep frustration over paying high prices for unreliable service, often resorting to VPNs to access essential online tools for work, study, and leisure.",

    "url": "https://thehftguy.com/2026/01/22/doing-gigabit-ethernet-over-my-british-phone-wires/",
    "summary": "The author details their quest to achieve gigabit-speed Ethernet in their British home, leveraging existing phone wires due to the widespread absence of installed Ethernet cabling. Frustrated with unreliable and slow powerline adapters (max 180 Mbps with high variance), and a 500 Mbps internet connection, they sought a dedicated solution.\n\nRecognizing that British houses are replete with phone sockets, the author theorized that G.hn technology (used in powerline adapters) could perform significantly better on dedicated phone lines. This led to the discovery of Gigacopper.net, a German manufacturer producing devices for Ethernet over phone lines.\n\nOrdering the Gigacopper G4201TM involved navigating post-Brexit import fees and delays with Royal Mail. The device uses an RJ11 connector for the phone line and an RJ45 for Ethernet. Initial setup was plug-and-play, immediately achieving the full 500 Mbps internet speed. The author later discovered and corrected, with vendor support, that they had bought the \"Client/Server\" variant instead of the more suitable \"InHome\" version for multi-device, low-latency home networks.\n\nDespite challenges in finding suitable testing hardware, full 1 Gbps speed was eventually verified using iperf3. An inspection of the house's phone wiring revealed a chaotic, daisy-chained setup with inconsistent 2, 3, or 4-wire connections, confirming that traditional 8-wire Ethernet cabling was impractical. The Gigacopper device, operating effectively over these existing wires, proved to be a \"miracle\" solution, demonstrating a significant untapped market for high-speed networking via British phone infrastructure.",
