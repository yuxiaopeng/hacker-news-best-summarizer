    "url": "https://openciv3.org/",
    "summary": "OpenCiv3 (formerly \"C7\") is an open-source, cross-platform, fan-built reimagining of Civilization III, developed with the Godot Engine and C#. Its aim is to modernize Civ3 for today's modders and players, removing arbitrary limits, fixing bugs, expanding mod capabilities, and supporting modern graphics and platforms, while retaining the original gameplay and content.\n\nCurrently in an early pre-alpha state, OpenCiv3 is a rudimentary playable game, though it lacks many mechanics and late-game content. Active development is ongoing, with updates shared via CivFanatics, Discord, and GitHub.\n\nThe v0.3 \"Dutch\" Preview 1 was released in December 2025, marking a major enhancement. This version introduces a standalone mode with placeholder graphics, although a local Civilization III installation (Conquests or Complete) is recommended for a more polished experience.\n\nOpenCiv3 is available for 64-bit Windows, Linux, and Mac OS. Installation involves downloading and extracting the appropriate files. Users can enhance graphics by directing OpenCiv3 to their Civ3 installation (either automatically on Windows or via a `CIV3_HOME` environment variable). Mac users must use a terminal command (`xattr -cr`) to unblock the application. Known issues include primitive standalone assets, incomplete support for Civ3 BIQ/SAV files, and specific Mac crashes when starting a new game.\n\nOpenCiv3 is free and open-source software released under the MIT License and is not affiliated with the original Civilization III developers or publishers.",

    "chinese_summary": "OpenCiv3（前身为“C7”）是一款开源、跨平台、玩家自制的《文明III》重制版，使用Godot引擎和C#开发。其旨在为当今的模组制作者和玩家对《文明III》进行现代化改造，移除随意限制、修复错误、扩展模组功能，并支持现代图形和平台，同时保留原版游戏玩法和内容。\n\nOpenCiv3目前处于早期预Alpha阶段，是一款初步可玩的游戏，尽管缺少许多游戏机制和后期内容。积极开发仍在进行中，更新通过CivFanatics、Discord和GitHub分享。\n\nv0.3“Dutch”预览版1于2025年12月发布，标志着一次重大增强。此版本引入了带有占位符图形的独立模式，但建议安装本地《文明III》（征服世界或完整版）以获得更完善的体验。\n\nOpenCiv3适用于64位Windows、Linux和macOS。安装涉及下载并解压相应文件。用户可以通过将OpenCiv3指向其《文明III》安装目录来增强图形（在Windows上自动识别，或通过`CIV3_HOME`环境变量指定）。Mac用户必须使用终端命令（`xattr -cr`）来解除应用程序的阻止。已知问题包括原始的独立资产、对《文明III》BIQ/SAV文件的不完整支持，以及在Mac上开始新游戏时可能发生的特定崩溃。\n\nOpenCiv3是根据MIT许可证发布的免费开源软件，且与《文明III》的原始开发者或发行商无关。"

    "summary": "Jesper Ordrup's \"Vocal Guide\" is a comprehensive reference covering 21 vocal techniques across five categories: register, style, effect, embellish, and dynamics. Each technique is rated for difficulty (1-5 dots), with prerequisites clearly linked. Safety is paramount: techniques marked with ⚠️ can cause damage, emphasizing the rule \"if it hurts, stop,\" and advising professional coaching for advanced techniques.\n\nThe guide includes a **Warm-Up Routine** featuring a pre-singing checklist (hydration, posture, tension release, no cold starts) and a 5-minute routine comprising breathing exercises, lip trills, humming, vowel slides, and sirens. An extended warm-up adds straw phonation, tongue trills, arpeggios, and gentle belting preparation.\n\n**Anatomy & Preparation** explains the functions of the diaphragm, vocal folds, larynx, and supporting muscles (abdominals, intercostals, back muscles), stressing their roles in breath control and sound production. It details correct posture and essential vocal health practices, including consistent hydration, steam inhalation, adequate rest, and avoiding harmful habits like whispering, excessive throat clearing, smoking, and dehydrating drinks.\n\nLastly, the guide debunks common **Vocal Myths & Bad Advice**, clarifying misconceptions such as directly \"singing from your diaphragm\" (it's about supporting muscles), tea/honey \"fixing\" the voice (they don't reach the folds), \"chest voice\" meaning sound from the chest (it's vocal fold vibration), falsetto being exclusive to men, alcohol/cigarettes creating a healthy rasp (they cause damage), pushing for high notes (less air, more compression is key), artificial vibrato, talent being purely innate (it's trainable), warm-ups being optional, and pain signifying strength (it signals damage).",

    "title": "SectorC: A C Compiler in 512 bytes (2023)",
    "url": "https://xorvoid.com/sectorc.html",
    "summary": "SectorC is a groundbreaking C compiler written in x86-16 assembly, fitting entirely within a 512-byte boot sector, making it likely the smallest C compiler ever. It supports a functional subset of C, including global variables, functions, `if`/`while` statements, numerous operators, pointer dereference, and inline machine code.\n\nThe project overcame initial challenges in tokenizing and parsing within such severe size constraints. \"Big Insight #1\" involved creating \"Barely C,\" a variant where strategic space-delimitation simplified tokens, effectively allowing \"mega-tokens.\" \"Big Insight #2\" utilized `atoi()` as a crude hash function for identifiers and keywords, eliminating the need for complex symbol tables and traditional string-to-integer conversions.\n\nAfter an attempt at Forth-style \"byte-threaded code\" proved inefficient, the straight-forward recursive-descent parser was meticulously optimized, shrinking from 468 to 303 bytes. This saving of 165 bytes allowed the integration of more advanced C features. Minimization tricks included extensive code reorganization for fall-through, tail-calls, call-fusion, and leveraging `stosw`/`lodsw` instructions. A `binary_oper_tbl` efficiently added many operators.\n\nError handling was deliberately omitted to conserve space. The compiler also integrates with a small runtime (`rt/lib.c`, `rt/_start.c`). Examples demonstrate its capability for low-level tasks, such as animating sine waves in VGA Mode 0x13 and playing music through the PC speaker, proving that significant functionality can be achieved under extreme size limitations.",
