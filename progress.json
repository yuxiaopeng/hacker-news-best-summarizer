    "summary": "AI World Clocks is a website created by Brian Moore that showcases the clock-generating capabilities of nine different AI models. Every minute, a new clock design is displayed, with each clock being uniquely generated by one of the AI models.\n\nThe AI models are tasked with creating the HTML/CSS code for an analog clock displaying a specific time. They are provided with a prompt that outlines the desired characteristics: responsive design, white background, an animated second hand, and the option to include numbers or numerals. The AI models are limited to 2000 tokens for code generation and instructed to return only the HTML/CSS without any markdown formatting.\n\nThe website credits Matthew Rayfield as the inspiration for the project and invites viewers to follow Brian Moore on Instagram. The user experience currently displays \"Loading...\" and \"Generating AI Clocks...\" messages, indicating the website is actively working to load and generate the AI-created clock displays. In essence, it's a demonstration of how AI can be used to generate visual elements like clock designs from coded instructions.\n",
