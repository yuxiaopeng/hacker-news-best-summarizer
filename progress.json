    "summary": "The author expresses his strong commitment to Linux, having \"ascended\" from Windows due to frustration with its \"AI guff,\" constant upsells, and the feeling of \"renting\" his own PC. He highlights that modern Linux distros are now genuinely user-friendly, dispelling decades-old misconceptions about their difficulty.\n\nHe praises Bazzite, a gaming-focused Linux distribution, for its ease of use even with an Nvidia GPU, noting that games run as well as, if not better than, on Windows without needing the command line. His old laptop, running Debian 13 as a media server, requires zero input and only contains desired software.\n\nThe article points to a growing trend, with Linux users reaching a new all-time high of 3.2% on the Steam hardware survey. While acknowledging issues like inconsistent HDR and anti-cheat compatibility for some live-service games, the author believes these are moving towards solutions. He urges readers to try Linux by 2026, suggesting they'll find the open-source environment more welcoming than anticipated.",

    "summary": "The article argues that the internet, once a vast realm of self-discovery and community, has devolved into an \"attention-farm\" of \"brain-rot\" and \"slop,\" replacing meaningful engagement with algorithmic content and commercial exploitation. Drawing on Ivan Illich's \"Tools for Conviviality,\" the author likens the internet's trajectory to the industrialization of the automobile: initially liberating, it eventually became a \"radical monopoly\" where society serves the tool, rather than the reverse.\n\nThis pattern, seen across textile manufacturing, antibiotics, and space exploration, holds true for the Web. What began as a vision of interoperability and accessibility has been co-opted by \"Big Tech,\" leading to a loss of ownership, privacy, and genuine connection.\n\nTo reclaim the \"Web We Want,\" the article proposes a return to \"convivial tooling,\" emphasizing user autonomy and creativity. This involves:\n1.  **Learning:** Shifting from monolithic platforms (YouTube, TikTok) to personal blogs using HTML, RSS, and webmentions for content ownership.\n2.  **Connecting:** Moving away from social media \"prisons\" to decentralized, self-generated social networks using protocols like ActivityPub and POSSE.\n3.  **Coding:** Embracing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for creative expression and craft, rather than solely for shareholder value.\n\nThe ultimate solution is **personal websites**: hand-coded, syndicated, and continually evolving. These bespoke sites are presented as the exemplary \"website to destroy all websites,\" enabling users to be autonomous, experiment, own their digital space, and foster genuine human connection, thereby winning the war for the soul of the internet.",

    "chinese_summary": "文章认为，互联网曾是自我探索和社群的广阔天地，但已沦为充斥着“精神腐蚀”和“垃圾信息”的“注意力农场”，用算法内容和商业剥削取代了有意义的互动。作者援引伊万·伊里奇的《为共同生存而设计的工具》，将互联网的轨迹比作汽车的工业化：汽车最初解放了人们，但最终却成为一种“彻底的垄断”，社会反过来为工具服务。\n\n这种模式在纺织品制造、抗生素和太空探索领域均有体现，对网络也同样适用。最初互操作性和可访问性的愿景已被“科技巨头”所掌控，导致所有权、隐私和真正连接的丧失。\n\n为了夺回“我们想要的网络”，文章提出回归“共同生存的工具”，强调用户自主性和创造力。这包括：\n1.  **学习：** 从（YouTube、TikTok 等）单一平台转向使用 HTML、RSS 和 Webmentions 的个人博客，以实现内容所有权。\n2.  **连接：** 摆脱社交媒体“牢笼”，转向使用 ActivityPub 和 POSSE 等协议的去中心化、自建社交网络。\n3.  **编码：** 拥抱 HTML、CSS 和 JavaScript，用于创意表达和精工细作，而不仅仅是为了股东价值。\n\n最终的解决方案是**个人网站**：手工编码、聚合发布并持续演进。这些定制网站被视为堪称典范的“摧毁所有网站的网站”，让用户能够自主、实验、拥有自己的数字空间，并培养真正的人际连接，从而赢得互联网灵魂之战。"

    "summary": "The Ghostty project requires users to create a Discussion first instead of directly submitting Issues. This policy stems from years of experience in open-source maintenance, aiming to keep the issue tracker focused solely on well-understood, actionable items ready for development.\n\nThe project uses GitHub Discussions for general dialogue, feature requests, and initial bug reports. Maintainers observe that a large percentage of user-reported \"bugs\" are often misunderstandings, environmental problems, or configuration errors, while most feature requests are underspecified.\n\nBy requiring a Discussion first, Ghostty ensures that only confirmed, reproducible problems or clearly defined feature requests are converted into formal Issues by a maintainer. This workflow streamlines the process for maintainers and contributors, making it easier to identify and work on items that are truly ready for implementation. Users finding a valid problem do not do extra work, as a maintainer will convert their Discussion to an Issue. More details are available in the CONTRIBUTING.md file.",

    "url": "https://www.madebywindmill.com/tempi/blog/hbfs-bpm/",
    "summary": "John Scalo, creator of the Tempi app, believes Daft Punk deliberately set the BPM of \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\" at 123.45 as an unnoticed Easter egg. While most online sources list the track around 123 BPM, Scalo argues for a more precise value, claiming human ear and manual measurement can be more accurate for exact BPMs than most software.\n\nUsing a method of identifying \"bookend\" beats, measuring their duration, and counting the total beats, Scalo analyzed both a Discovery CD rip and a YouTube version of the song. His calculations consistently yielded a BPM extremely close to 123.45 (e.g., 123.4499... and 123.4533...), with the original CD version being almost exactly 123.45.\n\nScalo hypothesizes that this sequential numerical tempo (1-2-3-4-5) was a deliberate, humorous choice. He investigated whether Daft Punk's production equipment for the *Discovery* album could support such precise fractional BPMs. While the E-mu SP-1200 and Akai MPC-3000 supported only one decimal place, Emagic Logic Audio (which they also used) supported BPMs up to four decimal places.\n\nGiven Logic's capability and the near-perfect match in the original CD version, Scalo concludes that 123.45 BPM was an intentional, hidden detail by Daft Punk, a subtle joke that has remained unnoticed for 25 years.",
    "chinese_title": "《更努力，更好，更快，更强》的BPM拍速中有蠢朋克彩蛋？",
    "chinese_summary": "Tempi 应用的开发者约翰·斯卡洛（John Scalo）认为，Daft Punk（傻朋克）乐队故意将《Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger》这首歌的 BPM（每分钟节拍数）设定为 123.45，作为一个未被察觉的彩蛋。尽管大多数在线资源将这首歌的 BPM 列为约 123，斯卡洛却主张一个更精确的数值，他声称对于精确的 BPM，人耳和手动测量比大多数软件更准确。\n\n斯卡洛采用了一种方法，即识别“首尾”节拍，测量它们的持续时间，并计算总节拍数，以此分析了《Discovery》专辑的 CD 抓轨版和这首歌的 YouTube 版本。他的计算结果始终非常接近 123.45 BPM（例如，123.4499...和 123.4533...），其中原版 CD 的结果几乎精确到 123.45。\n\n斯卡洛推测，这种顺序数字的节奏（1-2-3-4-5）是一个故意的、幽默的选择。他调查了 Daft Punk 制作《Discovery》专辑时使用的生产设备是否能支持如此精确的小数 BPM。尽管 E-mu SP-1200 和 Akai MPC-3000 只支持一位小数，但他们也使用的 Emagic Logic Audio 则支持精确到四位小数的 BPM。\n\n考虑到 Logic 软件的功能以及原版 CD 几乎完美的匹配，斯卡洛得出结论，123.45 BPM 是 Daft Punk 刻意为之的一个隐藏细节，一个在 25 年里一直未被察觉的微妙笑话。"

    "summary": "The study, published in Eurosurveillance, investigated the long-term impact of the Danish HPV vaccination program on the prevalence of oncogenic HPV genotypes in young women. Denmark introduced its national HPV vaccination program in 2009, initially targeting 12-year-old girls, and later expanding to include older age groups and boys.\n\nResearchers conducted a cross-sectional study between 2019 and 2022, enrolling over 11,000 women born between 1996 and 1999 (aged 20-23). Participants provided self-collected vaginal swabs, which were tested for 27 HPV genotypes. The study compared HPV prevalence between vaccinated and unvaccinated women.\n\nThe findings revealed a profound reduction in oncogenic HPV prevalence among vaccinated individuals. The prevalence of HPV16/18, the types responsible for the majority of cervical cancers, was a remarkably low 0.6% in vaccinated women, compared to 16.2% in unvaccinated women. This translates to an estimated vaccine effectiveness (VE) of 96% for HPV16/18. Additionally, VE against other oncogenic HPV types covered by the nonavalent vaccine (HPV31/33/45/52/58) was 82%. Importantly, no evidence of type replacement was observed, as the prevalence of non-vaccine HPV types was similar in both groups.\n\nThe study concludes that the Danish HPV vaccination program has been highly effective in drastically reducing the prevalence of oncogenic HPV types in vaccinated women, forecasting a significant future reduction in cervical cancer incidence.",
