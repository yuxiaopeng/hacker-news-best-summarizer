    "summary": "Claude has launched \"Cowork,\" a research preview designed to bring the advanced capabilities of Claude Code to a wider audience beyond developers. Available to Claude Max subscribers on macOS, Cowork allows users to grant Claude access to a specific folder on their computer, enabling it to read, edit, and create files within it.\n\nUnlike a typical conversation, Cowork gives Claude greater agency. Once assigned a task, Claude autonomously plans and executes the work—such as organizing downloads, creating spreadsheets from screenshots, or drafting reports from notes—while keeping the user informed. It integrates with existing connectors for external data and introduces new skills for document and presentation creation. When combined with Claude in Chrome, it can also perform browser-based tasks. This system aims to simplify workflows by reducing manual context provision and allowing parallel task processing.\n\nUser control is paramount: users explicitly choose which folders Claude can access, and Claude seeks approval before taking significant actions. However, users are cautioned about potential risks like accidental destructive actions (e.g., file deletion) if instructions are unclear, and \"prompt injections\" from external content. These risks are inherent to advanced AI tools with real-world agency.\n\nAs a research preview, Cowork will undergo rapid improvements based on user feedback, with future plans including cross-device sync and Windows compatibility, alongside continued safety enhancements.",

    "chinese_summary": "Claude 推出了“Cowork”，这是一个研究预览版，旨在将 Claude Code 的先进功能带给更广泛的受众，而不仅仅是开发者。Cowork 面向 macOS 上的 Claude Max 订阅用户提供，它允许用户授予 Claude 访问其电脑上特定文件夹的权限，使其能够在该文件夹内读取、编辑和创建文件。\n\n与典型的对话不同，Cowork 赋予了 Claude 更大的自主权。一旦分配任务，Claude 便会自主规划和执行工作——例如整理下载文件、根据截图创建电子表格或根据笔记起草报告——同时让用户了解进展。它集成了现有连接器以获取外部数据，并引入了用于文档和演示文稿创建的新技能。当与 Chrome 中的 Claude 结合使用时，它还可以执行基于浏览器的任务。该系统旨在通过减少手动提供上下文和允许并行处理任务来简化工作流程。\n\n用户控制至关重要：用户明确选择 Claude 可以访问的文件夹，并且 Claude 在采取重大行动之前会寻求批准。然而，用户需警惕潜在风险，例如指令不明确时可能导致意外的破坏性操作（例如文件删除），以及来自外部内容的“提示注入”。这些风险是具有实际操作能力的先进 AI 工具所固有的。\n\n作为一项研究预览，Cowork 将根据用户反馈进行快速改进，未来计划包括跨设备同步和 Windows 兼容性，以及持续的安全增强。"

    "summary": "The FBI raided the Virginia home of Washington Post reporter Hannah Natanson early Wednesday, seizing her electronic devices including a phone and laptops, a move the newspaper termed \"highly unusual and aggressive.\" The raid is part of an investigation into Aurelio Perez-Lugones, a government contractor accused of illegally retaining classified materials.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi confirmed the raid was conducted at the Pentagon's request, targeting a journalist obtaining and reporting classified information from Perez-Lugones, who is already in custody. Bondi stated the Trump administration would not tolerate illegal leaks posing national security risks. Despite the raid, agents told Natanson she was not the focus of the investigation or accused of wrongdoing, and neither she nor the Post were notified they were targets.\n\nThe Washington Post's executive editor, Matt Murray, condemned the \"extraordinary, aggressive action,\" raising \"profound questions and concern around the constitutional protections for our work.\" Natanson covers the federal workforce and has previously detailed receiving sensitive information from government employees.\n\nPress freedom groups unanimously denounced the raid as a \"tremendous intrusion\" and an \"alarming escalation\" in the administration's \"war on press freedom.\" They cited federal laws and constitutional protections for journalists, warning that such searches endanger confidential sources, impede public interest reporting, and are characteristic of authoritarian regimes. They demanded a public explanation for the search's necessity and legality, emphasizing its chilling effect on journalism amidst the Post's strained relationship with the Trump administration.",

    "url": "https://blog.metabrainz.org/2025/12/11/we-cant-have-nice-things-because-of-ai-scrapers/",
    "summary": "The \"article,\" titled \"We can't have nice things because of AI scrapers,\" presents its core argument through the ironic juxtaposition of its title and content. The title immediately suggests that the pervasive use of AI-driven web scraping negatively impacts the quality or accessibility of online resources and user experiences.\n\nThe accompanying content directly illustrates this premise by displaying a common anti-bot security message: \"正在确认你是不是机器人！ 加载中...请稍等，我们需要在继续之前检查您的连接安全性。\" (Confirming you are not a robot! Loading...Please wait, we need to check your connection security before continuing.)\n\nThis security check, which interrupts user flow and demands verification, is a direct countermeasure against automated access, including sophisticated AI scrapers. Therefore, the article's main point is conveyed by showing that the very necessity of implementing such protective measures—designed to combat AI scrapers—is what creates friction and inconvenience for legitimate human users, thus preventing them from having an unhindered \"nice thing\" (a seamless online experience). The key information is that AI scraping necessitates burdensome security checks, making online interactions less enjoyable.",

    "summary": "Scott Adams, the acclaimed creator of the \"Dilbert\" comic strip, died at 68 on January 13, 2026, following a battle with prostate cancer that had spread to his bones. His ex-wife, Shelly Miles, confirmed his death during a livestream, noting Adams had revealed on New Year's Day that his health outlook had become \"essentially zero.\"\n\nAdams left a \"final message\" written on New Year's Day, where he stated his body failed before his brain. He also revealed a late-life conversion, accepting Jesus Christ as his lord and savior at the persuasion of Christian friends, despite previously not being a believer. Miles described his passing as peaceful, surrounded by loved ones.\n\n\"Dilbert,\" launched in 1989, achieved wide acclaim for its satire of corporate life, earning Adams a Reuben Award and extensive global syndication. However, his career faced significant challenges in 2023 when many newspapers stopped running the strip due to racist comments he made, labeling Black people a \"hate group.\" Following this controversy, Adams relaunched the comic as a webcomic, \"Daily Dilbert Reborn.\"\n\nAdams authored several books in addition to his cartoon work. In his final letter, he expressed having an \"amazing life,\" wishing his legacy to be one of usefulness and conveying his love for his audience.",
