    "url": "https://hugodaniel.com/posts/claude-code-banned-me/",
    "summary": "Hugo Daniel, the author, reports being abruptly banned from his Claude account for a seemingly innocuous interaction: asking the AI to \"scaffold a `Claude.md` file.\" His intention was to generate documentation for an open-source project. Claude provided content for the markdown file, including sections on its capabilities and \"Safety and Ethical Considerations.\"\n\nShortly after this interaction, Daniel's account was terminated without warning. The ban notification cited a violation of Anthropic's \"Acceptable Use Policy\" due to \"user-generated content.\" Daniel points out the irony and absurdity that the AI itself generated the content deemed problematic, in response to a neutral prompt, leading to his ban. He argues that this highlights an alarming issue where AI safety mechanisms are overly broad and poorly implemented, potentially punishing users for the AI's own output.\n\nThe author expresses concern about the opaque nature of such moderation and its potential chilling effect on developers and researchers contributing to open-source projects. He suggests that these \"safety\" measures are overzealous and hinder legitimate, beneficial use cases, particularly when an AI's self-referential output can trigger a user ban.",

    "url": "https://e360.yale.edu/digest/europe-wind-solar-fossil-fuels",
    "summary": "Last year, wind and solar power for the first time surpassed fossil fuels as the primary electricity source in the E.U., according to an analysis by London-based think tank Ember. Wind and solar collectively generated 30 percent of E.U. power, slightly more than the 29 percent provided by fossil fuels. This significant shift is largely attributed to the rapid expansion of solar energy, which is growing faster than any other electricity source. Including hydropower, renewables supplied nearly half of all E.U. power.\n\nThe analysis highlights solar's widespread growth, supplying over 20 percent of power in countries like Hungary, Cyprus, Greece, Spain, and the Netherlands. Concurrently, coal use is in broad decline, accounting for less than 5 percent of power in 19 European countries, with Ireland and Finland having shuttered their last remaining coal plants.\n\nDespite these advances, challenges persist. Droughts, exacerbated by warming, have impacted hydropower output, leading to an increased reliance on natural gas to compensate. Ember analyst Beatrice Petrovich emphasized the E.U.'s priority should be to reduce its dependence on expensive, imported gas. Promisingly, increasingly affordable batteries are beginning to displace natural gas during peak evening demand, a trend expected to help stabilize energy prices as it accelerates.",
    "chinese_title": "欧洲风光超越化石燃料",
    "chinese_summary": "去年，根据伦敦智库Ember的分析，风能和太阳能首次超越化石燃料，成为欧盟的主要电力来源。风能和太阳能合计提供了欧盟30%的电力，略高于化石燃料的29%。这一重大转变主要归因于太阳能的迅速扩张，其增长速度超过任何其他电力来源。如果包括水力发电在内，可再生能源提供了欧盟近一半的电力。\n\n该分析强调了太阳能的广泛增长，在匈牙利、塞浦路斯、希腊、西班牙和荷兰等国家提供了超过20%的电力。与此同时，煤炭使用量普遍下降，在19个欧洲国家中，煤电占比不到5%，爱尔兰和芬兰已经关闭了它们仅存的燃煤电厂。\n\n尽管取得了这些进展，挑战依然存在。气候变暖加剧的干旱影响了水力发电的产出，导致对天然气的依赖增加以弥补不足。Ember分析师Beatrice Petrovich强调，欧盟的优先事项应该是减少对昂贵进口天然气的依赖。值得庆幸的是，价格日益亲民的电池在傍晚用电高峰期开始取代天然气，这一趋势预计将随着其加速发展而有助于稳定能源价格。"

LLM users also reported the lowest self-reported ownership of their essays and struggled to quote their own work.\n\nIn the crossover session, LLM users reassigned to Brain-only showed reduced neural connectivity (under-engagement). Conversely, Brain-only users introduced to LLMs exhibited higher memory recall and increased activation in critical brain areas, similar to Search Engine users.\n\nOver four months, LLM users consistently underperformed at neural, linguistic, and behavioral levels.
