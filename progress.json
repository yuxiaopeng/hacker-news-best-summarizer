    "title": "Microsoft forced me to switch to Linux",
    "url": "https://www.himthe.dev/blog/microsoft-to-linux",
    "summary": "The author, a lifelong Windows user, describes their forced migration to Linux due to Microsoft's aggressive and deteriorating Windows experience. After over 20 years of comfortable use, frustrations mounted with Windows 10 and 11, specifically citing unconsented updates that closed unsaved work, pervasive ads for OneDrive and Copilot, and critical system bugs.\n\nThe breaking point came with the 24H2 update, which installed without permission and caused a \"Chrome Seizure Incident\" leading to system freezes. Rollbacks failed, and even a fresh install didn't resolve the issue. An NVIDIA-Microsoft driver incompatibility further plagued the system, causing Chrome lock-ups, with both companies passing blame. The author realized Windows had become \"too much work\" and disrespectful, actively fighting the user.\n\nConsequently, the author switched to CachyOS, an Arch-based Linux distribution. Despite initial hurdles like broken sleep mode and the absence of a native Ableton Live, they successfully resolved NVIDIA driver issues and found native alternatives like Bitwig Studio.\n\nThe author's 2026 assessment of Linux highlights its strengths: full support for web browsing and software development, strong music production capabilities (Bitwig, PipeWire), and significantly improved gaming performance via Proton (especially for AMD GPUs, with NVIDIA catching up). While some content creation (Adobe) and 3D modeling still pose challenges, Linux's general usage is faster and more responsive.\n\nThe article concludes that the switch was not ideological but a forced response to Microsoft's self-sabotage, buggy updates, AI-driven code, and resource-intensive React Native apps, sarcastically deeming CEO Satya Nadella the \"biggest Linux evangelist.\"",
    "chinese_title": "微软迫使我改用 Linux。",
    "chinese_summary": "作者作为一名终身Windows用户，描述了他们由于微软激进且日益恶化的Windows使用体验而被迫迁移到Linux的经历。在20多年的舒适使用后，对Windows 10和11的挫败感日益增加，特别是提到了未经同意就关闭未保存工作的更新、OneDrive和Copilot无处不在的广告以及关键的系统bug。\n\n压垮骆驼的最后一根稻草是24H2更新，它未经许可自动安装，并导致了“Chrome抽搐事件”，进而引发系统冻结。回滚失败，甚至重新安装也未能解决问题。NVIDIA和微软的驱动不兼容进一步困扰着系统，导致Chrome卡死，而两家公司互相推诿责任。作者意识到Windows已经变得“太麻烦了”而且不尊重用户，它在积极地与用户作对。\n\n于是，作者转向了基于Arch的Linux发行版CachyOS。尽管最初遇到了一些障碍，例如睡眠模式失效和没有原生的Ableton Live，但他们成功解决了NVIDIA驱动问题，并找到了Bitwig Studio等原生替代品。\n\n作者对Linux在2026年的评估强调了它的优势：对网页浏览和软件开发的全面支持，强大的音乐制作能力（Bitwig、PipeWire），以及通过Proton显著提升的游戏性能（尤其是对于AMD显卡，NVIDIA也正在迎头赶上）。尽管一些内容创作（Adobe）和3D建模仍然面临挑战，但Linux的日常使用更快、响应更灵敏。\n\n文章总结认为，这次转换并非出于意识形态，而是对微软的自我破坏、充满bug的更新、AI驱动的代码以及资源密集型React Native应用的一种被迫回应，讽刺地称CEO萨提亚·纳德拉为“最大的Linux布道者”。"

    "url": "https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/28/patreon-apple-tax/",
    "summary": "Apple is set to implement a 30% commission on all payments made to Patreon creators via its iOS app, with a new deadline of November 1, 2026, for creators to adopt the App Store's in-app purchase system. Apple views these fan payments to creators as digital goods, justifying its entitlement to a commission.\n\nThe standard commission is 30% for in-app purchases and new subscriptions, which reduces to 15% for subscriptions active for over a year. Patreon offers creators two options: either raise their prices specifically for iOS users to offset Apple's fee, or absorb the cost themselves, maintaining consistent pricing across platforms.\n\nNotably, iPhone and iPad users can bypass Apple's commission by completing their payments through Patreon's website. Patreon has expressed its disappointment with Apple's policy. According to TechCrunch, a significant majority (96%) of Patreon creators have already switched from the platform's legacy billing system to Apple's required system, with only 4% remaining. Patreon has also released an FAQ to provide creators with more details.",

    "title": "Vitamin D and Omega-3 have a larger effect on depression than antidepressants",
    "url": "https://blog.ncase.me/on-depression/",
    "summary": "The article posits that Vitamin D and Omega-3 supplements demonstrate a greater impact on depression than conventional antidepressants. While antidepressants exhibit an average standardized effect size of approximately 0.4 (equivalent to improving mental health from a C to a C+), Omega-3s, particularly 1500 mg/day of \"≥60% EPA,\" show an effect size of around 0.6 to 1.0 (C to B– or B). The author notes current official Omega-3 recommendations are several times too low for optimal depression effects, though the suggested dose is well within safe limits (5000 mg/day).\n\nVitamin D is presented as even more effective, with an estimated effect size of about 1.8 at 5000 IU/day (not 5000 mg, as clarified). This is likened to a significant improvement from a C to an A– in mental health, and it's effective even for those without a diagnosed Vitamin D insufficiency. The author argues that official Vitamin D recommendations, including \"max safe dose,\" are outdated and too low.\n\nBoth supplements are described as safe, cheap, and over-the-counter, with additional benefits for Covid and cognitive function. They can be taken concurrently with antidepressants. The article urges individuals, unless contraindicated (e.g., kidney stones for Vitamin D, blood thinners for Omega-3), to try these supplements for at least a month, suggesting they could significantly improve mental health and potentially save lives.",
    "chinese_title": "维生素D和欧米伽-3对抑郁症的作用比抗抑郁药更大。",
    "chinese_summary": "文章指出，维生素D和Omega-3补充剂对抑郁症的影响比传统抗抑郁药更大。抗抑郁药的平均标准化效应量约为0.4（相当于将心理健康状况从C级提升到C+），而Omega-3，特别是每天1500毫克“≥60% EPA”的Omega-3，效应量约为0.6到1.0（从C级提升到B-或B级）。作者指出，目前官方推荐的Omega-3剂量对于获得最佳抗抑郁效果而言低了几倍，尽管建议的剂量远在安全范围内（每天5000毫克）。\n\n维生素D被认为更有效，估计每天5000国际单位（非5000毫克，已澄清）的效应量约为1.8。这被比作心理健康状况从C级显著提升到A-级，即使对于未被诊断为维生素D不足的人也有效。作者认为，包括“最大安全剂量”在内的官方维生素D推荐剂量已经过时且过低。\n\n这两种补充剂都被描述为安全、便宜、非处方药，并对新冠肺炎和认知功能有额外益处。它们可以与抗抑郁药同时服用。文章敦促个人，除非有禁忌症（例如，维生素D的肾结石，Omega-3的血液稀释剂），尝试服用这些补充剂至少一个月，并表示它们可能显著改善心理健康并有可能挽救生命。"

    "url": "https://web.mit.edu/jemorris/humor/500-miles",
    "summary": "In 2002, Trey Harris, a university email system administrator, received a bizarre report from the statistics department: they couldn't send emails farther than 500-520 miles. Initially incredulous, Harris personally verified the problem, confirming emails to destinations like New York (420 miles) worked, while those to Memphis (600 miles) or Providence (580 miles) failed.\n\nHis investigation revealed the root cause: a consultant's recent SunOS upgrade had inadvertently *downgraded* the server's Sendmail software from version 8 to version 5. Although the `sendmail.cf` configuration file, written by Harris, was designed for Sendmail 8, the older Sendmail 5 couldn't parse the new, longer option names. Consequently, critical settings, including the \"timeout to connect to the remote SMTP server,\" defaulted to zero.\n\nExperimentation showed a zero timeout aborted connection attempts after just over three milliseconds. Crucially, the campus network was 100% switched, meaning connection delays to remote hosts were largely governed by the speed of light, not router delays. Harris calculated that three \"millilightseconds\" (the time it took for the connection to abort) corresponds to approximately 558 miles, precisely explaining the mysterious 500-mile email limit as a literal, physical boundary caused by a software version mismatch.",

Launched on July 1, 2025, the mission aims to provide enhanced data on temperature and humidity, significantly improving the prediction of severe storms.\n\nThe satellite's Infrared Sounder instrument, the first European hyperspectral sounding instrument in geostationary orbit, captured full-disc images on November 15, 2025. These include a \"temperature\" map, showing warmer land surfaces (e.g., Africa, South America) in dark red and cooler cloud tops in blue, and a \"humidity\" map, depicting high humidity in blue and low humidity (e.g., Sahara Desert) in red. Close-up images of Europe and North Africa further illustrate temperature variations, and MTG-S successfully tracked the Hayli Gubbi volcano eruption on November 23, 2025, monitoring evolving ash plumes.\n\nOperating from geostationary orbit, MTG-S provides temperature and humidity data every 30 minutes, complementing cloud and lightning data from the MTG-Imager. Its 1700 infrared channels will enable the creation of three-dimensional maps of the atmosphere, including wind and trace gases, vastly improving nowcasting and allowing for earlier, more accurate predictions of extreme weather events. Developed by ESA in collaboration with partners like Eumetsat, this mission represents a significant advancement in Earth observation, with MTG-S also hosting the Copernicus Sentinel-4 mission.",
