    "title": "What an unprocessed photo looks like",
    "url": "https://maurycyz.com/misc/raw_photo/",
    "summary": "An unprocessed photo from a camera sensor is far from what we perceive. Initially, it's just a \"gray-and-gray\" image composed of analog-to-digital converter (ADC) values, often not utilizing the full theoretical range and lacking contrast.\n\nThe journey to a viewable image involves several processing steps:\n\n1.  **Ranging:** The initial ADC values need to be mapped to a displayable black and white range to improve contrast, transforming the \"gray-and-gray\" into something with clearer light and dark tones.\n2.  **Demosaicing:** Camera sensors don't see color directly; they use a Bayer filter array where each pixel captures only red, green, or blue light. To create a full-color image, a demosaicing algorithm averages neighboring pixel values to interpolate the missing color information for each pixel.\n3.  **Tone Mapping (Gamma Correction):** Even after demosaicing, the image appears dark. This is because display technologies have a limited dynamic range compared to sensors and human vision. Additionally, human perception of brightness is non-linear. Applying a non-linear curve (like sRGB) brightens darker areas, making the image more accurately represent perceived brightness.\n4.  **White Balance:** Camera sensors can be more sensitive to certain colors (like green), and demosaicing can amplify this, leading to color casts. White balance corrects these by adjusting the intensity of each color channel, ensuring neutral colors appear neutral. This step often needs to be done on the linear data before tone mapping.\n\nThe article concludes that even \"in-camera\" JPEGs undergo extensive mathematical processing. Adjusting an image in editing software isn't making it \"faker\" but rather a different rendition of the same raw data, aiming to better replicate human perception within the constraints of display technology.",

    "chinese_summary": "相机传感器未经处理的照片，远非我们所感知到的样子。最初，它只是一幅由模数转换器 (ADC) 值组成的“灰蒙蒙”图像，通常未充分利用其理论范围，且缺乏对比度。\n\n要转换为可观看的图像，需要经过以下几个处理步骤：\n\n1.  **定标：** 初始 ADC 值需要映射到可显示的黑白范围，以提高对比度，将“灰蒙蒙”的图像转换为具有更清晰明暗色调的图像。\n2.  **去马赛克：** 相机传感器不直接感知颜色；它们使用拜耳滤色阵列，其中每个像素只捕获红色、绿色或蓝色光。为了创建全彩图像，去马赛克算法会平均相邻像素值，以插值每个像素缺失的颜色信息。\n3.  **色调映射 (伽马校正)：** 即使在去马赛克之后，图像仍显得很暗。这是因为与传感器和人眼相比，显示技术的动态范围有限。此外，人眼对亮度的感知是非线性的。应用非线性曲线（如sRGB）可以提亮较暗区域，使图像更准确地呈现感知的亮度。\n4.  **白平衡：** 相机传感器可能对某些颜色（如绿色）更敏感，去马赛克可能会放大这种敏感性，导致偏色。白平衡通过调整每个颜色通道的强度来校正这些问题，确保中性色显示为中性。这一步通常需要在色调映射之前在线性数据上完成。\n\n文章总结道，即使是“机内”JPEG图像也经过了大量的数学处理。在编辑软件中调整图像并非使其“虚假”，而只是对相同原始数据进行不同形式的呈现，旨在显示技术限制内更好地复制人眼感知。"

    "summary": "Aaron T. Grogg's article, \"Replacing JS with Just HTML,\" advocates for leveraging native HTML and CSS features to reduce reliance on JavaScript for common web functionalities. Published on December 27, 2025, the piece argues that while JS has been vital, many tasks it traditionally handled can now be performed more efficiently by modern HTML and CSS, leading to better user experiences.\n\nThe core premise is that offloading functionality to native browser implementations means less JavaScript needs to be downloaded, decompressed, evaluated, and maintained in memory. This frees JS for more complex tasks while improving site performance.\n\nGrogg provides practical examples:\n1.  **Accordions/Expanding Content Panels:** Achieved with the `<details>` and `<summary>` elements, offering native open/close states and radio-button-like behavior with the `name` attribute.\n2.  **Input with Autofilter Suggestions Dropdown:** Implemented using an `<input>` element with the `list` attribute, linked to a `<datalist>` for automatic filtering of options.\n3.  **Modals/Popovers:** Replaced by the `popover` and `popovertarget` attributes on a `<dialog>` element, enabling various types of popovers with built-in light-dismiss and accessibility features.\n4.  **Offscreen Nav/Content:** Uses the `popover` attribute combined with CSS for animated transitions, creating JavaScript-free offscreen navigation menus.\n\nThe article encourages developers to prioritize native solutions where available, respecting JavaScript by using it for what it truly needs to do, thereby creating lighter and faster web applications.",
    "chinese_title": "仅用 HTML 替换 JavaScript",
    "chinese_summary": "Aaron T. Grogg的文章《仅用HTML替代JS》倡导利用原生的HTML和CSS功能，以减少对JavaScript在常见网页功能上的依赖。该文章于2025年12月27日发表，认为尽管JS一直至关重要，但许多它传统上处理的任务现在可以由现代HTML和CSS更高效地完成，从而带来更好的用户体验。\n\n核心前提是，将功能卸载到原生浏览器实现中，意味着需要下载、解压缩、评估和内存中维护的JavaScript更少。这将JS解放出来用于更复杂的任务，同时提高网站性能。\n\nGrogg提供了实用示例：\n1.  **手风琴/可展开内容面板：** 通过`<details>`和`<summary>`元素实现，提供原生的打开/关闭状态，并可使用`name`属性实现类似单选按钮的行为。\n2.  **带自动过滤建议的输入下拉框：** 使用带有`list`属性的`<input>`元素实现，该属性链接到一个`<datalist>`元素，以实现选项的自动过滤。\n3.  **模态框/弹出窗口：** 被`<dialog>`元素上的`popover`和`popovertarget`属性替代，能够实现各种类型的弹出窗口，并具有内置的轻量级关闭和辅助功能。\n4.  **屏外导航/内容：** 结合CSS动画过渡，使用`popover`属性，创建无需JavaScript的屏外导航菜单。\n\n该文章鼓励开发人员在可用时优先考虑原生解决方案，尊重JavaScript，将其用于真正需要它的地方，从而创建更轻量、更快速的Web应用程序。"

    "title": "You can make up HTML tags",
    "url": "https://maurycyz.com/misc/make-up-tags/",
    "summary": "This article highlights that HTML developers can create and use custom tags (e.g., `<cool-thing>`) instead of generic `div`s with classes. Browsers automatically treat these unrecognized tags as generic elements, applying any styles defined for them in CSS. This isn't a quirk but standardized behavior. Including hyphens in custom tag names (e.g., `<main-article>`) guarantees they won't conflict with future HTML standards.\n\nThe main benefit of this approach is greatly improved code readability and maintainability, especially for complex or deeply nested structures. The article contrasts a series of nested `div`s with classes, which can be hard to navigate, with a structure using descriptive custom tags. The latter eliminates the need for `</div>` counting, making it much easier to understand the structure and pinpoint insertion points. While existing semantic HTML tags should be used when appropriate, custom tags offer a more readable alternative to extensive use of `<div>` or `<span>` with numerous class names, providing better clarity for custom components.",
    "chinese_title": "You can make up HTML tags",
    "chinese_summary": "本文强调HTML开发者可以创建和使用自定义标签（例如`<cool-thing>`），而不是使用带有类的通用`div`标签。浏览器会自动将这些未识别的标签视为通用元素，并应用在CSS中为其定义的任何样式。这并非一个异常，而是标准化行为。在自定义标签名称中包含连字符（例如`<main-article>`）可以确保它们不会与未来的HTML标准冲突。\n\n这种方法的主要好处是极大提升了代码的可读性和可维护性，尤其对于复杂或深度嵌套的结构。文章对比了一系列难以理解的带类的嵌套`div`结构，以及使用描述性自定义标签的结构。后者消除了对`</div>`进行计数的需要，使得理解结构和精确找到插入点变得容易得多。尽管在适当情况下应使用现有的语义化HTML标签，但自定义标签为大量使用带有众多类名的`<div>`或`<span>`提供了一种更具可读性的替代方案，从而为自定义组件提供了更好的清晰度。"
