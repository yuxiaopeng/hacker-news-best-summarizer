    "url": "https://www.kielinstitut.de/publications/americas-own-goal-who-pays-the-tariffs-19398/",
    "summary": "A Kiel Policy Brief analyzes the 2025 US tariffs, concluding they are an \"own goal\" as American importers and consumers bear nearly the entire cost. The study, utilizing shipment-level data from over 25 million transactions valued at nearly $4 trillion, found that approximately 96% of the tariff burden is passed through to US buyers, with foreign exporters absorbing only about 4%. This results in \"near-complete pass-through\" to US import prices.\n\nThe analysis projects that the surged US customs revenue of approximately $200 billion in 2025 will be almost entirely a tax paid by Americans. Event studies on discrete tariff shocks, such as 50% on Brazil and 25-50% on India, confirm that export prices did not decline; instead, trade volumes collapsed. Indian export customs data validates these findings, showing that Indian exporters maintained their prices and reduced shipments when facing US tariffs, rather than absorbing the cost. Authors Hinz, Lohmann, and Mahlkow from the Kiel Institute highlight that these tariffs directly burden US businesses and consumers.",
    "chinese_title": "美国进口商和消费者承担2025年关税成本：分析",
    "chinese_summary": "基尔政策简报分析了2025年美国关税，结论是这些关税是一个“乌龙球”，因为美国进口商和消费者几乎承担了全部成本。这项研究利用了来自逾2500万笔交易（总价值近4万亿美元）的货物层面数据，发现大约96%的关税负担转嫁给了美国买家，而外国出口商仅承担了大约4%。这导致了关税“近乎完全地”转嫁到美国进口商品价格上。\n\n该分析预计，2025年美国将激增约2000亿美元的海关收入，而这笔收入将几乎完全是美国人支付的税款。对离散关税冲击（例如对巴西征收50%关税、对印度征收25-50%关税）的事件研究证实，出口价格并未下降；相反，贸易量大幅萎缩。印度出口海关数据验证了这些发现，表明印度出口商在面对美国关税时，维持了价格并减少了出货量，而非承担成本。基尔研究所的作者Hinz、Lohmann和Mahlkow强调，这些关税直接加重了美国企业和消费者的负担。"

    "url": "https://kudmitry.com/articles/dead-internet-theory/",
    "summary": "The author recounts an experience on HackerNews where an open-source project faced accusations of being AI-generated. Despite the project author's denials, the article's author observed AI-like linguistic patterns (e.g., specific em-dash usage, phrases like \"you are absolutely right\") in their comments, leading to profound uncertainty about the reality of online interactions. This experience triggered a recognition of the \"Dead Internet Theory.\"\n\nThe Dead Internet Theory suggests that since roughly 2016, the internet is predominantly populated by bots and machine-generated content, largely for marketing and SEO purposes. The author contrasts this with their youth in the early 2000s, recalling genuine human connections and learning in communities like IRC and phpBB forums.\n\nToday, distinguishing human from AI is increasingly difficult, as evidenced by AI-altered photos on LinkedIn and pervasive AI-generated \"horror stories\" on various social media platforms. The author expresses sadness and hopelessness over the mass availability of AI, which facilitates the creation of \"AI-slop\" and raises concerns about a future where bots interact mainly with other bots, and human knowledge is merely recycled for commercial gain, questioning the ultimate utility and original purpose of the internet and technology itself.",
    "chinese_title": "死亡互联网理论",
    "chinese_summary": "作者回忆了在HackerNews上的一次经历，当时一个开源项目被指控是AI生成的。尽管项目作者否认了，但文章作者却在他们的评论中观察到类似AI的语言模式（例如，特定破折号的使用，以及“你绝对正确”之类的短语），这导致作者对网络互动的真实性产生了深刻的不确定性。这一经历让他想起了“死寂互联网理论”。\n\n死寂互联网理论认为，大约从2016年起，互联网就主要被机器人和机器生成的内容所占据，这主要是为了营销和SEO目的。作者将此与自己2000年代初的青春时期进行对比，回忆起在IRC和phpBB论坛等社区中真实的人际连接和学习。\n\n如今，区分人类和AI变得越来越困难，这一点从LinkedIn上AI篡改的照片以及各种社交媒体平台上泛滥的AI生成“恐怖故事”可见一斑。作者对AI的大规模普及表示悲伤和绝望，这助长了“AI糟粕”的产生，并引发了对未来机器人主要与其他机器人互动、人类知识仅仅被回收用于商业利益的担忧，进而质疑了互联网和技术本身的最终效用和最初目的。"

    "summary": "Apple is testing a new App Store design on iOS 26.3 that blurs the distinction between search ads and organic results. The key change is the removal of the blue background that previously highlighted sponsored results. Now, the only differentiator for an ad is a small 'Ad' banner next to the app icon, making it harder for users to quickly identify paid placements.\n\nThis design is currently in an A/B test phase and may be linked to Apple's December announcement that App Store search results would soon include multiple sponsored ads per query. By removing the blue background, all ads will appear more integrated within the search list.\n\nWhile this change is not ideal for user experience, as it could mislead users into unknowingly clicking on ads, it is expected to increase click-through rates and ultimately boost Apple's advertising revenue. Apple has been contacted for clarity on a wider rollout.",

    "chinese_summary": "苹果正在iOS 26.3上测试一项新的App Store设计，该设计模糊了搜索广告与自然结果之间的界限。关键变化在于移除了此前用于突出显示赞助结果的蓝色背景。现在，广告唯一的区别标志是应用图标旁边的一个小小的“广告”标识，这使得用户更难快速识别付费位置。\n\n这项设计目前处于A/B测试阶段，并可能与苹果去年12月宣布App Store搜索结果将很快在每次查询中包含多个赞助广告的声明有关。通过移除蓝色背景，所有广告在搜索列表中将显得更具整合性。\n\n尽管这一改变对用户体验并不理想，因为它可能误导用户无意中点击广告，但预计会提高点击率，并最终提升苹果的广告收入。已就此项设计的更广泛推广计划联系了苹果公司以寻求澄清。"

    "summary": "Radboud University has selected Fairphone as the standard smartphone for its employees, effective February 1, 2026. This decision stems from the university's commitment to sustainability, cost efficiency, and streamlined management.\n\nFairphones are highly sustainable, featuring easily replaceable components like batteries and screens to extend their lifespan. Production prioritizes fair and recycled materials, along with ensuring good working conditions.\n\nWhile new Fairphones will be issued by the Information & Library Services (ILS) division, the university will first re-issue available used Samsung devices that meet technical and age requirements. Employees with existing university-issued iPhones can continue using them until they no longer function, but no new iPhones will be issued. Staff may also use their private phones for work with an RU SIM card, though device costs will not be reimbursed. All existing university and privately used work phones will continue to receive ILS support.\n\nStandardizing on Fairphone is expected to reduce total costs due to the devices' longer lifespan. Managing a single model simplifies purchasing, stock, support, and training, leading to faster incident handling and replacements. This move aligns with Radboud University's circularity strategy, which focuses on maximizing the use and reuse of ICT hardware, supported by Fairphone's five-year warranty and up to eight years of software support.",
