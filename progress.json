    "url": "https://burkeholland.github.io/posts/opus-4-5-change-everything/",
    "summary": "The author, initially a skeptic, now firmly believes AI coding agents, specifically Claude Opus 4.5, can replace human developers. He describes Opus 4.5 as a departure from typical AI agent experiences, which often result in \"spaghetti code\" and frustrating debugging loops. Opus 4.5, instead, delivers on the promise of AI for coding.\n\nHe illustrates this with four projects:\n1.  **Windows Image Conversion Utility:** Built mostly in one shot, demonstrating Opus's accuracy and ability to self-debug, even handling distribution and GitHub Actions.\n2.  **Screen Recording/Editing App:** Started as a simple GIF recorder but scaled into a complex image/video editor in mere hours, highlighting Opus's UI development capabilities.\n3.  **AI Posting Utility:** A complex mobile app involving Facebook authentication, Firebase backend, storage, and scheduled posting. Opus 4.5 built a functional iOS app and admin dashboard almost entirely, utilizing the Firebase CLI and automatically resolving cloud function errors, while the author was occupied elsewhere.\n4.  **Order Tracking and Routing App:** Integrated Gmail, Google authentication, and Firebase to manage business orders, routes, and drive times, replacing two paid apps, again built rapidly.\n\nThe author acknowledges he doesn't fully understand the generated code (e.g., in Swift), but finds this irrelevant as Opus 4.5 reliably fixes its own bugs. He advocates for \"LLM-first\" code, optimized for machine reasoning and regenerability rather than human readability, guided by a custom agent prompt. While Opus can suggest refactors, security (e.g., API key handling) remains a significant manual concern. The author expresses both exhilaration at the newfound building speed and depression over the potential obsolescence of his learned skills, concluding by urging others to build but to remain vigilant about security.",
    "chinese_title": "Opus 4.5 不是我迄今为止经历过的寻常AI代理体验。",
    "chinese_summary": "作者最初持怀疑态度，但现在坚信AI编码代理，特别是Claude Opus 4.5，可以取代人类开发者。他将Opus 4.5描述为与典型AI代理体验的不同之处，后者常常导致“意大利面条式代码”和令人沮丧的调试循环。Opus 4.5则兑现了AI在编码方面的承诺。\n\n他通过四个项目阐释了这一点：\n1.  **Windows图像转换工具：** 大部分功能一次性完成，展示了Opus的准确性和自调试能力，甚至还能处理分发和GitHub Actions。\n2.  **屏幕录制/编辑应用：** 最初是一个简单的GIF录制器，但在短短数小时内扩展成一个复杂的图像/视频编辑器，突显了Opus的用户界面开发能力。\n3.  **AI发布工具：** 一个复杂的移动应用，涉及Facebook认证、Firebase后端、存储和定时发布。Opus 4.5几乎完全构建了一个功能性的iOS应用和管理后台，利用Firebase CLI并自动解决了云函数错误，而作者当时正忙于其他事务。\n4.  **订单追踪和路线规划应用：** 集成了Gmail、Google认证和Firebase，用于管理业务订单、路线和驾驶时间，取代了两个付费应用，同样迅速构建完成。\n\n作者承认他并不完全理解所生成的代码（例如Swift代码），但他认为这无关紧要，因为Opus 4.5能够可靠地修复自身的bug。他提倡“LLM优先”的代码，这种代码是为机器推理和可再生性而非人类可读性而优化，并由自定义代理提示引导。尽管Opus可以建议重构，但安全性（例如API密钥处理）仍然是一个需要手动关注的重要问题。作者既为新获得的构建速度感到兴奋，也为自己所学技能可能过时感到沮丧，最后他敦促其他人积极构建，但要对安全性保持警惕。"

    "title": "AWS raises GPU prices 15% on a Saturday, hopes you weren't paying attention",
    "url": "https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/05/aws_price_increase/",
    "summary": "AWS has quietly raised prices for its EC2 Capacity Blocks for ML, specifically NVIDIA H200-powered p5e and p5en instances, by approximately 15% on a Saturday in January 2026. For instance, the p5e.48xlarge jumped from $34.61 to $39.80 per hour in most regions. AWS attributed the hike to \"supply and demand patterns.\"\n\nThis increase is highly significant because AWS has historically favored price reductions or pricing model changes over direct, straight-up increases for core compute services. Capacity Blocks are crucial for companies requiring guaranteed GPU capacity for demanding machine learning workloads, often with multi-million dollar budgets.\n\nThe author, Corey Quinn, argues this is a \"bellwether\" moment, suggesting it's not an anomaly but the start of a new trend. He contends it breaks AWS's two-decade-long conditioning of customers to expect prices to only go down. This precedent makes future price increases for other constrained resources, such as RAM or Graviton instances, more likely. The move also hands competitors like Azure and GCP a significant talking point and impacts customers with Enterprise Discount Programs by increasing their absolute costs. Quinn concludes that the assumption of perpetually decreasing cloud pricing \"died on a Saturday in January,\" marking a fundamental shift in AWS's pricing playbook, driven by global supply constraints and rising costs.",
    "chinese_title": "AWS周六将GPU价格上调15%，希望你没注意到。",
    "chinese_summary": "AWS 在2026年1月的某个周六悄然上调了其面向机器学习的 EC2 容量块（特别是采用 NVIDIA H200 驱动的 p5e 和 p5en 实例）的价格，涨幅约为15%。例如，在大多数区域，p5e.48xlarge 实例的价格从每小时34.61美元跃升至39.80美元。AWS 将此次涨价归因于“供需模式”。\n\n此次涨价意义重大，因为 AWS 历来对于核心计算服务倾向于降价或调整定价模型，而非直接、纯粹的提价。容量块对于那些需要有保障的 GPU 容量以运行高要求机器学习工作负载的公司至关重要，这些公司通常拥有数百万美元的预算。\n\n作者 Corey Quinn 认为这是一个“风向标”时刻，表明这并非异常现象，而是新趋势的开端。他主张这打破了 AWS 二十年来让客户习惯于价格只会下降的惯性。这一先例使得未来其他受限资源（如内存或 Graviton 实例）的价格上涨更有可能。此举也为 Azure 和 GCP 等竞争对手提供了一个重要的谈资，并通过增加绝对成本影响了拥有企业折扣计划的客户。Quinn 总结说，云服务价格将永久下降的假设“在某个1月的周六消亡了”，标志着 AWS 定价策略在受到全球供应限制和成本上涨驱动下的根本性转变。"

    "summary": "Cory Doctorow's speech, \"The Post-American Internet,\" delivered at the Chaos Communications Congress, argues that Donald Trump's trade policies have inadvertently created an opportunity for a new, \"enshittification-resistant\" internet. Doctorow, an EFF activist for 25 years, details his fight against \"anticircumvention\" laws, which criminalize modifying digital products without manufacturer approval.\n\nThese laws, such as the US DMCA Section 1201 and the EU Copyright Directive Article 6, originated in the US to benefit its tech giants, enabling them to control user experience and extract value (e.g., Apple's App Store commissions, John Deere's proprietary repair systems). Crucially, the US forced these laws onto trading partners worldwide through free trade agreements, leveraging threats of tariffs on essential exports.\n\nDoctorow explains that Trump's unilateral tariffs, though disruptive, have removed the US's coercive leverage. Since tariffs are now a reality, other nations are no longer bound to uphold anticircumvention laws to avoid them. This \"Happy Liberation Day\" scenario allows countries to repeal these restrictive laws as a strategic response, rather than simply retaliating with their own tariffs or capitulating.\n\nRepealing anticircumvention would empower domestic tech sectors to create \"disenshittification\" products—solutions that allow users to regain control over their devices and services. This would capture economic value currently flowing to American Big Tech. Doctorow envisions a powerful coalition of digital rights activists, national security hawks concerned with digital sovereignty, and local businesses eager to compete, forming an \"unstoppable\" force to build this post-American internet.",
