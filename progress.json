    "summary": "The creator of OpenClaw announced he is joining OpenAI to focus on making AI agents universally accessible, aiming to develop an agent simple enough for anyone to use, including his mother. His decision stems from a desire to \"change the world\" through technology, rather than build another large company, believing that partnering with OpenAI offers the fastest route to achieve this vision by providing access to the latest models and research, and ensuring safe development.\n\nOpenClaw, his \"playground project,\" will transition into an independent, open-source foundation, ensuring its continued freedom and growth. OpenAI has committed to sponsoring the project, and the author will dedicate time to its community of thinkers and hackers who prioritize data ownership.\n\nAfter engaging with various major labs in San Francisco, the author found OpenAI's vision aligns perfectly with his own. He is \"super excited\" to contribute to the frontier of AI research and development, while maintaining his commitment to OpenClaw's open-source ethos. \"The claw is the law.\"",

    "summary": "Fourteen-year-old Miles Wu from New York City secured the $25,000 top prize at the 2025 Thermo Fisher Scientific Junior Innovators Challenge for his groundbreaking origami research. Wu spent over 250 hours designing and testing variations of the Miura-ori pattern, a series of tessellating parallelograms, with the goal of developing strong, collapsible, and cost-efficient deployable shelters for emergency situations like natural disasters.\n\nWu conducted meticulous experiments, creating 54 different variants from various paper types. He tested their strength by adding weights until they broke, eventually needing 50-pound exercise weights as his patterns held significantly more than anticipated. Astonishingly, his strongest Miura-ori pattern supported over 10,000 times its own weight.\n\nJudges lauded Wu for transforming his passion for origami into a rigorous structural engineering project, showcasing innovation, adaptability, and leadership. Princeton engineer Glaucio H. Paulino recognized the project's value in demonstrating how tuning the Miura-ori's cell size and fold angle can significantly increase its strength-to-weight ratio, a vital property for deployable systems.\n\nWhile his findings are promising, scaling Wu's design to full-sized shelters requires further engineering considerations, including material thickness, non-linear property scaling, joint design, and resistance to multidirectional loads. Wu plans to develop an actual prototype emergency shelter, continue testing its strength against various forces, and further explore origami's applications in STEM.",

Paulino认可该项目的价值，因为它展示了如何通过调整三浦折叠的单元尺寸和折叠角度，显著提高其强度重量比，这是部署式系统的一项关键特性。\n\n尽管他的发现很有前景，但将吴迈尔斯的设计扩展到全尺寸庇护所需要进一步的工程考量，包括材料厚度、非线性特性缩放、连接点设计以及对多向载荷的抵抗能力。吴迈尔斯计划开发一个实际的紧急避难所原型，继续测试其在各种力下的强度，并进一步探索折纸在STEM领域的应用。"

    "summary": "Specialist online investigator Greg Squire, with the US Department of Homeland Security, faced a dead end trying to rescue a 12-year-old girl named Lucy, whose abuse images were circulating on the dark web. The abuser meticulously hid identifying features, and initial clues like light sockets only narrowed the location to North America. Facebook declined to assist with facial recognition.\n\nSquire's team meticulously analyzed every visible detail in Lucy's bedroom photos, including her bedspread, outfits, and stuffed toys. A minor breakthrough came when they identified a sofa sold only regionally, but this still amounted to 40,000 potential customers across 29 states.\n\nThe crucial clue emerged from an exposed brick wall in Lucy's room. Squire contacted the Brick Industry Association, which connected him with expert John Harp. Harp identified the distinctive \"Flaming Alamo\" brick, produced in the US southwest from the 60s to mid-80s. Harp's key insight – \"heavy bricks don't go very far\" – allowed the team to drastically narrow the sofa customer list to those within a 100-mile radius of the brick factory.\n\nUsing this refined list, they found a photo of Lucy on social media with a woman, possibly a relative. They then cross-referenced addresses, sending photos of potential homes to Harp to assess if they were likely to contain the specific brick. This led them to a single address where they confirmed Lucy was living with her mother's boyfriend, a convicted sex offender.\n\nWithin hours, the abuser was arrested and later sentenced to over 70 years in jail for raping Lucy for six years. The intense work took a toll on Squire's mental health, but he found support. Years later, Squire met Lucy, now an adult, who shared her gratitude, calling her rescue \"a prayer answered.\"",

The article argues that while Bluetooth is pervasive—from phones to medical devices, vehicles, and wearables—we underestimate its privacy implications, often lacking the option to disable it.\n\nRunning Bluehood passively, the author discovered detailed patterns, including neighbours' routines, delivery schedules, and precise times individuals were home or away, all achievable with basic hardware like a Raspberry Pi. This metadata can reveal significant behavioural insights to a \"bad actor.\" Ironically, some privacy-focused tools like Briar and BitChat, designed for secure, off-grid communication, necessitate Bluetooth activation, creating a tension where one privacy measure compromises another.\n\nBluehood is a Python application that passively scans, classifies devices, analyzes presence patterns, and presents data via a web dashboard. Its intent is educational, demonstrating how much can be inferred from seemingly innocuous Bluetooth signals. The project aims to make users aware of the trade-offs involved in leaving Bluetooth enabled, encouraging informed decisions about their device privacy.",

    "summary": "The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) has ordered the deletion of Courtsdesk, the UK's largest court reporting database, through HM Courts & Tribunals Service (HMCTS). Launched in 2020 with MoJ approval, Courtsdesk was a digital archive used by over 1,500 journalists to track criminal court cases, including magistrates’ court lists and registers.\n\nHMCTS issued a cessation notice in November 2025, citing \"unauthorised sharing\" of court information after Courtsdesk reportedly sent data to a \"third-party AI company.\" This decision is being criticized as a \"blow for open justice,\" with concerns that crucial cases will now go unreported. Courtsdesk founder Enda Leahy stated the platform frequently found that media were not notified about hearings, and claimed HMCTS's own records were only 4.2% accurate, with 1.6 million criminal hearings proceeding without advance press notice.\n\nLeahy attempted 16 times to save the service, seeking intervention from the Information Commissioner’s Office and former Justice Minister Chris Philp, but all requests were refused last week. Despite the order, the MoJ maintains that journalists will continue to have full access to court information, as listings and records remain available, and their action was necessary to protect sensitive data. The deletion of the archive is imminent.",
