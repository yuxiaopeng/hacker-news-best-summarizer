    "summary": "In the article \"I'm Kenyan. I don't write like ChatGPT, ChatGPT writes like me,\" Marcus Olang challenges the common perception that AI writing is a bland, generic imitation of human text. Instead, he argues that the writing style produced by Large Language Models like ChatGPT is, in fact, an aggregation and average of the vast amount of internet data it was trained on—much of which comes from global writers, including those from non-Western backgrounds.\n\nOlang, a Kenyan writer, contends that the AI's \"average\" style often mirrors the clear, direct, and sometimes slightly formal English prevalent in countries like Kenya, where English is an official language but often used with distinct cultural nuances and a focus on clarity over stylistic flourish. He points out that this style, common among millions of non-native English speakers contributing to the internet, forms a significant portion of the AI's training data.\n\nThe author suggests that the \"genericity\" attributed to AI writing is not a new, artificial construct, but rather a reflection of a widely adopted global English register. He implies that rather than humans adapting to an AI style, the AI is effectively synthesizing and reflecting a style already in widespread human use, particularly among those from the Global South who contribute extensively to online content. This perspective reframes the discussion about AI's impact on writing, highlighting its role as a mirror of diverse global linguistic contributions.",

    "chinese_summary": "在题为《我是肯尼亚人。我不像ChatGPT那样写作，ChatGPT像我一样写作》的文章中，马库斯·奥朗（Marcus Olang）挑战了普遍的看法，即人工智能写作是对人类文本平淡、缺乏个性的模仿。相反，他认为像ChatGPT这样的大型语言模型所产生的写作风格，实际上是其训练所用的海量互联网数据的聚合与平均——其中很大一部分来自全球作家，包括非西方背景的作家。\n\n作为肯尼亚作家的奥朗主张，人工智能的“平均”风格常常反映出在肯尼亚等国家普遍存在的清晰、直接、有时略显正式的英语。在这些国家，英语是官方语言，但使用时常带有独特的文化细微之处，并注重清晰度而非修辞华丽。他指出，这种在数百万为互联网贡献内容的非母语英语使用者中普遍存在的风格，构成了人工智能训练数据的重要组成部分。\n\n作者认为，归因于人工智能写作的“通用性”并非一种全新的人工建构，而是对一种广泛采用的全球英语语域的反映。他暗示，与其说是人类适应人工智能的风格，不如说是人工智能有效地综合并反映了一种已在人类中广泛使用的风格，特别是那些来自“全球南方”并为在线内容做出大量贡献的人。这一观点重新构建了关于人工智能对写作影响的讨论，强调了它作为反映全球多样化语言贡献的一面镜子的作用。"

    "summary": "Koi Research has uncovered a major privacy breach involving \"privacy\" browser extensions, primarily Urban VPN Proxy and seven others from the same publisher, affecting over 8 million users on Chrome and Edge. These extensions secretly harvest complete AI conversations from platforms like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.\n\nThe extensions inject scripts into AI chat pages, intercepting every prompt, AI response, conversation ID, and session metadata. This sensitive data—including personal dilemmas, health questions, financial details, and proprietary information—is then exfiltrated to Urban VPN's servers, operated by Urban Cyber Security Inc., which is affiliated with the data broker BiScience, and sold for \"marketing analytics.\"\n\nThis harvesting capability was silently added via an auto-update in July 2025 (version 5.5.0) and operates continuously in the background, regardless of whether the VPN or \"AI protection\" features are active. Ironically, the extensions warn users about sharing sensitive data with AI companies while simultaneously collecting and selling that exact data themselves.\n\nDespite carrying \"Featured\" badges from Google and Microsoft, implying a high standard of review and trust, these extensions explicitly violate store policies against selling user data to third-party data brokers. Their store listings contradict their privacy policies regarding data sale and the scope of information collected, fundamentally misleading users.\n\nUsers are advised to uninstall any of these extensions immediately and assume all AI conversations since July 2025 have been compromised.",

    "chinese_summary": "Koi研究揭露了一项重大的隐私泄露，涉及“隐私”浏览器扩展程序，主要是Urban VPN Proxy及其同属一家发行商的另外七个扩展程序，影响了Chrome和Edge上超过800万用户。这些扩展程序秘密收集来自ChatGPT、Claude和Gemini等平台上的完整AI对话。\n\n这些扩展程序向AI聊天页面注入脚本，拦截每一个提示、AI回复、对话ID以及会话元数据。这些敏感数据——包括个人困境、健康问题、财务细节和专有信息——随后被传输到由Urban Cyber Security Inc.运营的Urban VPN服务器，该公司与数据经纪商BiScience存在关联，并将数据出售用于“营销分析”。\n\n这项收集功能于2025年7月（5.5.0版）通过自动更新悄悄添加，并且无论VPN或“AI保护”功能是否启用，都会在后台持续运行。讽刺的是，这些扩展程序在警告用户不要与AI公司共享敏感数据时，却同时自行收集并出售这些数据。\n\n尽管带有Google和Microsoft的“推荐”徽章，这暗示着高标准的审查和信任，但这些扩展程序却明确违反了商店关于禁止向第三方数据经纪商出售用户数据的政策。它们的商店列表与隐私政策中关于数据销售和信息收集范围的规定相矛盾，从根本上误导了用户。\n\n建议用户立即卸载任何此类扩展程序，并假定自2025年7月以来的所有AI对话都已遭到泄露。"

The author finds this framing \"disgusting\" and unsupported by evidence, asserting that **nothing is truly inevitable** in technology.\n\nThe core argument is that modern technology is inherently **abusive**, conditioning users to accept constant changes, ignore their needs, and surrender agency, leading to widespread frustration. This abuse, coupled with relentless marketing, manufactures consent, hype, and perceived consumer needs.\n\nThe author provides numerous examples of technologies and trends, from internet-connected beds, AI browsers, and unrepairable devices to NFTs, the Metaverse, and Microsoft collecting user screenshots for AI training, all of which are emphatically declared **not inevitable**. These are presented as creations of \"tech grifters\" who exploit personal data and attention for profit.\n\nUltimately, the article urges readers to resist complicity, maintain a perspective on a **desirable future**, and recognize that every technological choice is a political statement and a conscious tradeoff.",

    "url": "https://ericdaigle.ca/posts/super-secure-maga-messaging-app-leaks-everyones-phone-number/",
    "summary": "The \"super secure\" MAGA-themed messaging app, Freedom Chat (formerly Converso), has been found to leak users' phone numbers and PINs, despite its CEO, Tanner Haas, relaunching it after previous, well-documented security failures.\n\nConverso, the predecessor, falsely claimed advanced E2EE and decentralization but was found by researcher crnković to store messages with derivable keys on centralized servers and upload them to an open Firebase bucket. After rebranding as Freedom Chat to appeal to \"conservative circles\" concerned with privacy, the app exhibits continued fundamental security flaws.\n\nSecurity researcher Eric Daigle discovered two critical vulnerabilities. First, simply by viewing a public channel, the app broadcasts the six-digit PINs of all channel members, including the creator, in plain text to every other member. This exposes the PIN of anyone in a channel (which includes all default users).\n\nSecond, Freedom Chat's contact discovery feature, accessed via the `/user/numbers` API endpoint, allows users to upload phone numbers and receive UIDs and Seald keys for registered users. Critically, this endpoint, akin to a past WhatsApp vulnerability, is *not* rate-limited.\n\nCombining these flaws, an attacker can enumerate all registered Freedom Chat phone numbers via the un-rate-limited endpoint. By correlating these phone numbers with the UIDs exposed in public channel member data, the attacker can link specific phone numbers to their associated PINs. This means any user who has joined a channel on Freedom Chat has had their phone number and PIN exposed, making the \"super secure\" claims entirely baseless.",

    "summary": "This article from The Big Newsletter reveals that secret documents from a recent Federal Trade Commission (FTC) lawsuit against PepsiCo illustrate how Pepsi and Walmart allegedly colluded to raise food prices. The documents, including internal emails and transcripts of phone calls, suggest a close coordination between the two corporate giants rather than competitive negotiations.\n\nThe investigation uncovered that Pepsi provided Walmart with confidential pricing information for its competitors, including Coca-Cola and Dr Pepper, effectively giving Walmart an unfair advantage in negotiations with other suppliers. Furthermore, Pepsi offered Walmart a higher \"list price\" for its products, knowing Walmart would then demand higher prices from other vendors. In return, Walmart would offer more prominent shelf space and better advertising to Pepsi.\n\nThis arrangement, described by the author as a \"cartel,\" allowed both companies to increase their profits at the expense of consumers. The article highlights that these practices align with classic antitrust violations, indicating a deliberate effort to manipulate the market and stifle competition. The author argues that this evidence supports the need for greater antitrust enforcement and stricter regulations against such corporate behavior.",
