    "summary": "Let's Encrypt celebrates the tenth anniversary of its first publicly-trusted certificate issuance in September 2015, marking a decade of significant growth and impact on web security. Now the world's largest certificate authority, it has issued billions of certificates, protecting nearly a billion websites, and helped standardize the ACME protocol.\n\nA cornerstone of its success is the vision of scalability through automation. Daily certificate issuance grew from 1 million in March 2016 to 1 million per day by September 2018, and over 10 million per day by late 2025. This rapid expansion dramatically increased HTTPS encryption prevalence, moving from under 30% to around 80% globally and 95% in the U.S. within five years.\n\nKey milestones include its first certificate (Sept 2015), reaching a billion total certificates in 2020, and introducing features like wildcard support (2018) and IP address certificates (2025). The organization also tackled significant technical scaling challenges, upgrading infrastructure to handle immense data volumes and continuously engaging in PKI engineering.\n\nWhile aiming to make certificates invisible, Let's Encrypt acknowledges the risk of its services being taken for granted, highlighting the ongoing need for recognition and support. It has received prestigious awards like the Levchin Prize. Crucial initial backing came from Mozilla, EFF, Cisco, Akamai, and especially IdenTrust, whose cross-signature support enabled public trust from the outset. As a nonprofit, Let's Encrypt seeks continued donations and sponsorships to pursue its mission of lowering barriers to a more secure and private Internet.",

It also heavily emphasizes performance optimization, covering animating view transitions, optimizing loading sequences through various import strategies (Static, Dynamic, On Visibility, On Interaction, Route Based), Bundle Splitting, the PRPL pattern, Tree Shaking, Preload/Prefetch, third-party optimization, List Virtualization, and JavaScript compression.\n\nThe **React Patterns** section provides overviews of React.js and Next.js, detailing patterns such as Container/Presentational, HOC, Render Props, Hooks, and Compound components. It thoroughly explains rendering strategies like Client-side, Server-side, Static, Incremental Static Generation, Progressive Hydration, Streaming SSR, and React Server Components, alongside optimizing Next.js for Core Web Vitals and future stack recommendations.\n\nThe **Vue Patterns** section covers core concepts including Components (Async, Dynamic, Renderless), Composables, Container/Presentational, Data Provider, Provide/Inject, Render functions, `<script setup>`, and State Management, guiding users on structuring and optimizing Vue.js applications.",
