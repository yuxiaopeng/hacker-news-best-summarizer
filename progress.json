    "summary": "Bose has announced a user-friendly decision to open-source the API documentation for its SoundTouch smart speakers, preventing them from becoming obsolete after official cloud support ends. The original support end date of February 18th, 2026, has also been extended to May 6th, 2026.\n\nInstead of bricking the devices, Bose will release an update to the SoundTouch app adding local controls, ensuring continued functionality. Users will still be able to stream music via Bluetooth, AirPlay, Spotify Connect, and AUX connections. Remote control, speaker grouping, and setup features will also remain operational.\n\nThe open-sourcing of the API empowers users to develop their own tools and solutions to fill any gaps left by the discontinuation of cloud services. This move is notably rare, as products typically become unusable when their cloud support ends, often leading to community-driven efforts to keep them functional. Bose's approach allows owners to continue utilizing their SoundTouch speakers, rather than rendering them useless.",

    "chinese_summary": "Bose宣布了一项用户友好的决定，将其SoundTouch智能音箱的API文档开源，以避免在官方云支持结束后这些音箱报废。原定的2026年2月18日支持截止日期也已延长至2026年5月6日。\n\nBose并未让这些设备变砖，而是将发布SoundTouch应用的更新，增加本地控制功能，确保其持续运行。用户仍可通过蓝牙、AirPlay、Spotify Connect和AUX连接播放音乐。远程控制、音箱分组和设置功能也将继续可用。\n\nAPI的开源使用户能够开发自己的工具和解决方案，以填补云服务中止后留下的任何空白。这一举动非常罕见，因为产品通常在云支持结束后便无法使用，这往往会促使社区成员努力使其继续运行。Bose的这种做法让所有者能够继续使用他们的SoundTouch音箱，而不是让它们变成废品。"

    "summary": "A GitHub pull request (PR) to add an `/llms.txt` endpoint for LLM-optimized Tailwind CSS documentation sparked a heated debate after being rejected by Adam Wathan, co-founder of Tailwind Labs.\n\nThe PR, initiated by `quantizor` in November 2025, aimed to provide a text-only, concatenated version of the documentation for large language models. However, Wathan closed the PR in January 2026, revealing that Tailwind Labs had laid off 75% of its engineering team the previous day due to AI's \"brutal impact\" on their business.\n\nWathan explained that traffic to their documentation, the primary channel for discovering their commercial products, was down 40% from early 2023. He stated that further optimizing docs for LLMs would likely reduce human traffic even more, jeopardizing the business's sustainability and their ability to maintain the framework. He denied accusations of hidden monetization, clarifying that their sponsorship-tiered `AGENTS.md` offers personal LLM best practices, not the documentation itself.\n\nThe community reaction was mixed. Many expressed disappointment, viewing the decision as \"OSS unfriendly\" and questioning the company's priorities. Some suggested alternative monetization strategies, like integrating prompts for paid products within LLM interactions or implementing pay-per-crawl solutions for AI bots. Others supported Wathan's stance, emphasizing the need for the company's financial stability and urging community members to support Tailwind Labs financially. The efficacy of `/llms.txt` as an official standard for LLMs was also debated.",

The \"Eat Real Food\" initiative introduces a \"New Pyramid\" to combat this, redefining \"real food\" as whole, nutrient-dense, naturally occurring options that are minimally processed and free from added sugars, industrial oils, artificial flavors, or preservatives.\n\nThe New Pyramid prioritizes three core food groups:\n1.  **Protein, Dairy & Healthy Fats:** Emphasizes high-quality protein (0.54–0.73 grams per pound of body weight daily) from both animal and plant sources, paired with healthy fats from whole foods like eggs, seafood, meats, full-fat dairy, nuts, seeds, olives, and avocados.\n2.  **Vegetables & Fruits:** Recommends 3 servings of vegetables and 2 servings of fruits daily, focusing on a wide variety of whole, colorful, and nutrient-dense options.\n3.  **Whole Grains:** Encourages 2–4 servings per day of fiber-rich whole grains (e.g., oats, rice, true sourdough), while strictly limiting highly processed, refined carbohydrates.\n\nThis flexible framework highlights protein and vegetables as foundational for muscle, metabolic, and gut health. It supports healthy fats, strongly discourages added sugars entirely, and stresses hydration with water or unsweetened beverages. The overall goal is to rebuild a food culture rooted in health, science, transparency, and personal responsibility, guiding Americans toward consistent, real food choices.",

    "summary": "Former President Donald Trump has proposed a ban on large institutional investors, often referred to as Wall Street firms, from purchasing single-family homes if he is re-elected. The initiative aims to address the housing affordability crisis by reducing competition for individual homebuyers and making homeownership more accessible for American families, especially first-time buyers.\n\nTrump stated that the bulk buying of single-family properties by these corporate entities drives up prices and transforms communities into a \"rental nation,\" making it increasingly difficult for ordinary citizens to afford a home. While specific details on the definition of \"large institutional investors\" and the exact implementation of the ban are yet to be fully outlined, the proposal signals an intent to curb speculative investment in the residential market. This policy, presented as a way to restore the American dream of homeownership, seeks to rebalance the market in favor of individuals over corporate landlords, alleviating financial burdens on prospective homeowners.",

    "summary": "A 2016 analysis by UC San Francisco researchers, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, uncovered industry documents revealing that the sugar industry deliberately influenced nutrition science in the mid-1960s. Their goal was to divert blame for coronary heart disease (CVD) from sugar to fat and cholesterol, while downplaying sugar's role as a risk factor.\n\nIndustry records showed a sugar trade organization anticipated in 1954 that low-fat diets would significantly increase sucrose consumption. As evidence linking sugar to high blood cholesterol and triglycerides (both CVD risk factors) emerged, the industry commissioned \"Project 226.\" They paid Harvard scientists the equivalent of $50,000 (2016 dollars) to produce a literature review, published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) in 1967.\n\nThe sugar industry set the review's objective, contributed articles, and reviewed drafts, yet their funding and involvement were not disclosed. The NEJM review heavily criticized studies linking sugar to heart disease and minimized limitations in fat studies. It concluded that reducing dietary cholesterol and substituting polyunsaturated for saturated fat were the only necessary interventions, asserting blood cholesterol as the sole significant risk factor, thereby sidestepping sugar's impact on triglycerides.\n\nLead author Cristin Kearns stated this review profoundly shaped public and scientific opinion on heart disease causes. The UCSF researchers emphasized the critical need for scientific reviews to be conducted by individuals free of conflicts of interest and for mandatory financial disclosure in nutrition science, especially as mounting evidence now links added sugars to hypertension and CVD.",
