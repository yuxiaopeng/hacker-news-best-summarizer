The remainder of the content is an unrelated technical message from Mastodon in Chinese, which explains that its web application requires JavaScript and suggests using platform-specific apps, a detail irrelevant to GrapheneOS's security features.",

    "url": "https://rfd.shared.oxide.computer/rfd/0576",
    "summary": "This Oxide RFD (Request for Discussion) outlines guidelines for using Large Language Models (LLMs) at the company, emphasizing that while LLMs are powerful tools, their use must align with core values.\n\n**Guiding Values:**\n*   **Responsibility:** The paramount value. Employees are fully responsible for all artifacts created, even with LLM assistance; human judgment remains essential.\n*   **Rigor:** LLMs can sharpen thinking but can also replace it with \"generated flotsam\" if used carelessly.\n*   **Empathy:** Maintain empathy for human readers and writers.\n*   **Teamwork:** LLM use shouldn't erode trust. Disclosing LLM use for generating work implicitly distances one from responsibility.\n*   **Urgency:** While LLMs offer speed, pace must not compromise responsibility, rigor, empathy, or teamwork.\n\n**Uses of LLMs:**\n*   **Readers:** Excellent for summarization and answering questions from large documents. Caveats include data privacy (ensure models don't train on uploaded data) and not substituting for human reading where expected.\n*   **Editors:** Useful for late-stage feedback on structure and phrasing, helping to retain one's voice. Caution against using too early in the process.\n*   **Writers:** Generally discouraged. LLM-generated prose is often hackneyed, undermines authenticity, and erodes the social contract of intellectual exertion between writer and reader. Oxide values its employees' writing skills.\n*   **Code Reviewers:** Can be helpful for specific issues but are not a substitute for human review.\n*   **Debuggers:** Can act as a \"rubber duck\" to inspire questions, surprisingly effective at times, but not to be solely relied upon.\n*   **Programmers:** Very effective for experimental or \"throwaway\" code. Greater care is needed for core systems. The engineer is fully responsible for LLM-generated code, requiring rigorous self-review before peer review. Wholesale re-generation during peer review is discouraged.\n\n**Determinations:** LLM use is broadly encouraged at Oxide, but always under the strict condition that it aligns with the company's deep sense of responsibility to its products, customers, and each other.",
    "chinese_title": "在 Oxide 使用 LLM",
    "chinese_summary": "这份Oxide的RFD（讨论请求）概述了公司内部使用大型语言模型（LLM）的指导方针，强调LLM虽然是强大的工具，但其使用必须符合公司的核心价值观。\n\n**核心价值观：**\n*   **责任：** 最重要的价值观。员工对所有产出物负全部责任，即使有LLM辅助；人类的判断力仍至关重要。\n*   **严谨：** LLM可以提升思维敏锐度，但若使用不慎，也可能用“生成物残渣”取代思考。\n*   **同理心：** 对人类读者和作者保持同理心。\n*   **团队合作：** 使用LLM不应损害信任。披露LLM在生成作品中的使用，无形中会削弱个人责任感。\n*   **紧迫性：** 虽然LLM能带来速度，但速度绝不能损害责任、严谨、同理心或团队合作。\n\n**LLM的用途：**\n*   **阅读者：** 非常适用于从大量文档中进行总结和回答问题。注意事项包括数据隐私（确保模型不会用上传数据进行训练），以及在预期需要人工阅读的场景中不能取代人工阅读。\n*   **编辑：** 在后期阶段为结构和措辞提供反馈时很有用，有助于保持个人风格。警惕在流程初期过早使用。\n*   **作者：** 通常不鼓励使用。LLM生成的散文往往陈词滥调，损害原创性，并削弱作者与读者之间智力投入的社会契约。Oxide珍视员工的写作技能。\n*   **代码审查员：** 对特定问题有帮助，但不能取代人工审查。\n*   **调试员：** 可以充当“橡皮鸭”来启发问题，有时效果出奇，但不能完全依赖。\n*   **程序员：** 对于实验性或“一次性”代码非常有效。对于核心系统需要更谨慎。工程师对LLM生成的代码负全部责任，在同行评审前需要严格的自我审查。不鼓励在同行评审期间进行大规模重新生成。\n\n**结论：** Oxide总体上鼓励使用LLM，但前提是必须严格遵守公司对其产品、客户以及彼此之间深切的责任感。"

    "url": "https://telefoncek.si/2025/02/2025-02-10-hidden-microphone-on-nanokvm/",
    "summary": "The article details the NanoKVM, a compact and affordable hardware KVM switch from Chinese company Sipeed, designed for remote computer control without requiring software installation on the target machine. Despite its promise of open-source code and features like virtual keyboard/mouse/monitor emulation, the author discovered significant security flaws.\n\nThese issues include initial shipments with default SSH passwords, user interface vulnerabilities (e.g., no CSRF protection), and a hardcoded encryption key for web logins, making password decryption easy. The device relies on Chinese DNS servers, communicates with Sipeed servers for updates, and stores identification keys in plaintext. Alarmingly, it lacks software update integrity verification and comes preinstalled with network analysis \"hacking tools\" like tcpdump and aircrack.\n\nThe most concerning discovery was a tiny, unmentioned 2x1mm microphone built into the device. With pre-installed audio recording tools (amixer, arecord), an attacker could easily record audio via SSH, potentially enabling real-time eavesdropping. Physical removal is possible but challenging due to the microphone's size.\n\nThe author attributes these flaws to negligence and rushed development rather than malicious intent. However, the open-source nature allows for custom firmware installations, offering a path to better security. Users can also physically remove the microphone or repurpose it with a speaker. The article concludes by questioning how many other devices might harbor hidden functionalities, noting that privacy concerns are not exclusive to Chinese products, citing examples with Apple and Google. Instructions for testing the microphone are provided.",

    "summary": "The German state of Schleswig-Holstein is embarking on a significant transition, phasing out Microsoft products in favor of open-source alternatives for its state administration. This move, announced by Digitalization Minister Jan Philipp Albrecht, aims to achieve greater digital sovereignty, improve data protection and security, and generate substantial cost savings.\n\nOver the next four years, the state will replace Microsoft Office with LibreOffice and migrate its 30,000 employees from Windows to a Linux-based operating system. Additionally, Exchange will be replaced by Open-Xchange, and other proprietary solutions will be swapped for open-source counterparts. The project is expected to save the state an estimated 13 million euros in licensing fees over a four-year period, alongside increased long-term cost benefits from eliminating vendor lock-in.\n\nThe decision was driven by a desire for independence from a single vendor, enhanced control over its IT infrastructure, and the ability to customize software to its specific needs. The migration will be implemented in phases, with the first 2,500 employees transitioning to LibreOffice this year. This ambitious project positions Schleswig-Holstein as a leading example within Germany and Europe for embracing open source in public administration.",

    "summary": "This article revisits the desktop setups of several prominent developers and Unix figures, comparing their environments from 2002 to 2015. Prompted by renewed interest in a previous compilation, the author reached out to Brian Kernighan, Richard Stallman, Bram Moolenaar, Rasmus Lerdorf, Warren Toomey, Jordan Hubbard, and Timothee Besset.\n\nA consistent theme across many participants is an enduring preference for command-line interfaces and terminal windows. Brian Kernighan and Richard Stallman both maintained very text-centric, minimalist setups, with Stallman primarily using Emacs in a console. Bram Moolenaar (Vim author) and Rasmus Lerdorf (PHP creator) still heavily utilize xterms and browsers, albeit with updated software like Chrome and Thunderbird.\n\nOver the 13 years, some significant shifts occurred: Warren Toomey transitioned from FreeBSD to Lubuntu Linux, switched window managers (fvwm to LXDE) and shells (tcsh to bash), and now uses many GUI tools alongside his command-line workflow. Jordan Hubbard remained on OS X but adopted its virtual desktops for organization. Timothee Besset demonstrated a modern approach, managing his Linux desktop configuration \"as code.\"\n\nDespite evolutions in operating systems, window managers, browsers, and email clients, the core ethos of a powerful, often text-based, development environment remains strong among these veterans, complemented by new tools and system capabilities like virtual desktops and robust hardware performance.",
