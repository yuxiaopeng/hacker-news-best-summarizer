    "title": "What an unprocessed photo looks like",
    "url": "https://maurycyz.com/misc/raw_photo/",
    "summary": "An unprocessed photo from a camera sensor is not colorful, but a \"gray-and-gray\" image with a limited brightness range. The initial 14-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) output needs its values mapped to a full 0-255 range for basic contrast.\n\nTrue color is introduced by a Bayer filter array on the sensor, where each pixel only captures red, green, or blue light. To create a full-color image, a process called demosaicing averages neighboring pixel values to interpolate the missing color information for each pixel.\n\nEven after demosaicing, the image appears dark. This is because human perception of brightness is non-linear, and linear sensor data displayed directly on monitors (with limited dynamic range) appears underexposed. Applying a non-linear curve (gamma correction) brightens these dark areas.\n\nA common issue is a green cast, due to the sensor's higher sensitivity to green and the Bayer filter having twice as many green pixels. This is corrected through white balance, which equalizes the color channels. These steps, including dynamic range adjustment, demosaicing, gamma correction, and white balance, represent the bare minimum processing.\n\nThe article concludes that a camera's \"unedited\" JPEG is already the product of extensive mathematical processing, not a direct raw output. Editing software adjustments merely replicate and refine these in-camera processes, aiming to produce an image that best represents human perception within the constraints of display technology.",
    "chinese_title": "未处理照片的样子",
    "chinese_summary": "未经处理的相机传感器照片并非彩色，而是一个亮度范围有限的“灰蒙蒙”图像。初始的14位模数转换器 (ADC) 输出需要将其值映射到完整的0-255范围，以获得基本对比度。\n\n真正的色彩是通过传感器上的拜耳滤镜阵列引入的，其中每个像素只捕捉红色、绿色或蓝色光。为了创建全彩色图像，一个称为去马赛克的过程会平均相邻像素值，以插值每个像素缺失的颜色信息。\n\n即使在去马赛克之后，图像看起来依然很暗。这是因为人类对亮度的感知是非线性的，并且线性传感器数据直接显示在显示器上（动态范围有限）会显得曝光不足。应用非线性曲线（伽马校正）可以提亮这些暗区。\n\n一个常见问题是偏绿，这源于传感器对绿色光较高的敏感性以及拜耳滤镜中绿色像素数量是其他颜色的两倍。这通过白平衡进行校正，白平衡能够均衡色彩通道。这些步骤，包括动态范围调整、去马赛克、伽马校正和白平衡，代表了最低限度的处理。\n\n文章总结说，相机“未经编辑”的JPEG图像已经是大量数学处理的产物，而非直接的原始输出。编辑软件的调整只是复制和细化了这些相机内部的处理，旨在在显示技术的限制下，生成一个最能代表人类感知的图像。"

    "url": "https://www.theocharis.dev/blog/kidnapped-by-deutsche-bahn/",
    "summary": "The author recounts a bizarre experience with Deutsche Bahn (DB) on December 24th, 2025, attempting a 35-kilometer train journey from Cologne to Meckenheim. The RE5 train was already 20 minutes late, which the author ironically considered \"early\" given DB's lenient punctuality metrics (trains under six minutes late are \"on time\"; cancelled trains aren't counted).\n\nInitially, the driver announced \"issues around Bonn,\" suggesting passengers exit early or continue to Troisdorf, where the author planned to meet his father. However, as the train approached Troisdorf, the driver astonishingly declared they were \"not registered\" for the tracks and \"cannot stop,\" forcing the author to watch his father waiting at the station as the train sped past.\n\nThe train continued past 15 stations, heading towards Neuwied, 63 kilometers from the grandmother's house – further than the starting point and in a different federal state. Feeling like \"cargo,\" the author overheard an English passenger exclaim, \"I am being kidnapped,\" a sentiment met with a resigned \"Deutsche Bahn\" from a fellow passenger.\n\nUltimately, this unexpected detour meant the author was \"kidnapped at a loss,\" as the potential compensation of 1.50 EUR fell below DB's 4.00 EUR minimum payout threshold. The incident highlights profound operational failures and a pervasive lack of accountability within Deutsche Bahn.",
    "chinese_title": "被德国铁路绑架",
    "chinese_summary": "作者讲述了2025年12月24日乘坐德国铁路（DB）的一次离奇经历，当时他正尝试完成从科隆到梅肯海姆35公里的火车旅程。RE5列车已经晚点20分钟，鉴于德国铁路宽松的正点率标准（晚点不足六分钟的列车算“准点”；取消的列车不计），作者讽刺地认为这已经算“早”了。\n\n起初，司机宣布“波恩附近有问题”，建议乘客提前下车或继续前往特罗斯多夫，作者原计划在那里与父亲会面。然而，当列车接近特罗斯多夫时，司机竟声称他们“未在此轨道登记”，“无法停车”，迫使作者眼睁睁看着父亲在车站等候，而列车却疾驰而过。\n\n列车继续开过15个车站，驶向诺伊维德，那里距离祖母家63公里——比起点更远，且位于另一个联邦州。感觉自己像“货物”一样，作者无意中听到一位英国乘客惊呼：“我被绑架了！”对此，另一位乘客无奈地回应了一句“德国铁路”。\n\n最终，这次意想不到的绕行意味着作者“被绑架，还蒙受损失”，因为潜在的1.50欧元赔偿低于德国铁路4.00欧元的最低赔付门槛。此次事件凸显了德国铁路深刻的运营失误和普遍的问责缺失。"

This strategic move aims to secure GOG's future by allowing it to operate more independently and with greater agility outside of the larger CD PROJEKT group.\n\nMarcin Iwiński, who will transition from his role as Joint CEO of CD PROJEKT to lead GOG, stated that the acquisition will enable GOG to refocus on its core mission: digital game preservation, offering DRM-free titles, and maintaining a gamer-first platform.\n\nFor users, there will be no immediate changes. Existing game libraries, accounts, GOG GALAXY functionality, and customer support will remain unaffected. GOG's commitment to DRM-free games, regional pricing, existing payment methods, and relationships with developers and publishers will all continue as before. The acquisition is seen as an opportunity for GOG to \"rediscover its unique DNA,\" fostering closer ties with its community and reinforcing its founding principles. The deal is currently pending regulatory approval.",

    "summary": "Z80-μLM is a 'conversational AI' project showcasing how small a language model can be while retaining personality and easy distribution. Designed to run on a vintage Z80 processor with 64KB RAM, the entire system—including inference, weights, and a chat-style UI—fits into a ~40KB .COM file. It generates short, character-by-character sequences, leveraging quantization-aware training (QAT) to operate within its extremely constrained environment.\n\nThe model interacts using trigram hash encoding, abstracting input into 128 buckets. This makes it typo-tolerant and word-order invariant for short phrases, although it struggles with longer, order-dependent sentences. Responses are intentionally terse (1-2 words), conveying nuance through context, as demonstrated by examples like \"tinychat\" (Q&A) and \"guess\" (a 20 Questions game).\n\nArchitecturally, it utilizes 128 input/context buckets, configurable hidden layers, and outputs characters. A key innovation is its 2-bit weight quantization, packing four weights per byte, and exclusive reliance on Z80-native 16-bit integer arithmetic for all calculations. Custom assembly loops efficiently handle multiply-accumulate operations and arithmetic right-shifts to prevent overflow.\n\nWhile not designed for novel sentence generation or deep multi-turn context, Z80-μLM excels at fuzzy matching, establishing personality through vocabulary, and functioning on severe 8-bit hardware limitations. It is offered under an MIT or Apache-2.0 license.",
