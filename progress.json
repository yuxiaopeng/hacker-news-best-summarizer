    "url": "https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/31/the-year-in-llms/",
    "summary": "2025 was a transformative year for LLMs, characterized by several key developments. OpenAI's \"reasoning\" revolution (RLVR) in early 2025 significantly enhanced models' ability to break down problems, proving crucial for driving tools, improving AI-assisted search, and excelling at code generation and debugging. This breakthrough fueled the practical emergence of \"agents\"—LLMs that execute multi-step tasks by running tools in a loop.\n\nThe most impactful event was Anthropic's quiet release of Claude Code in February, pioneering \"coding agents\" that write, execute, and iterate on code. Other major labs quickly followed with their own CLI and asynchronous web-based coding agents, valued for security and parallel task execution. LLMs also saw widespread adoption on the command line, with tools like Claude Code achieving a $1 billion revenue run-rate, simplifying complex Unix commands. However, the common use of \"YOLO\" (automatic confirmation) mode in agents raised security concerns, dubbed the \"normalization of deviance.\"\n\nA new $200/month subscription tier (e.g., Claude Pro Max, ChatGPT Pro) emerged, driven by the substantial token consumption of advanced agents. Crucially, Chinese AI labs like DeepSeek and Qwen dramatically rose to dominate open-weight model rankings, releasing powerful, often open-source models competitive with top Western offerings, causing a brief market re-evaluation. LLMs also made enormous strides in tackling \"long tasks,\" capable of completing multi-hour software engineering projects, and prompt-driven image editing became a highly successful consumer product.",
    "chinese_title": "2025年：LLMs年度回顾",
    "chinese_summary": "2025年对大型语言模型（LLM）而言是具有变革性的一年，其特点是出现了几项关键进展。2025年初，OpenAI的“推理”革命（RLVR）显著增强了模型分解问题的能力，这对于驱动工具、改进AI辅助搜索以及在代码生成和调试方面表现出色至关重要。这一突破推动了“代理”（即通过循环运行工具来执行多步骤任务的LLM）的实际应用。\n\n最具影响力的事件是Anthropic在二月悄然发布了Claude Code，它开创了能够编写、执行和迭代代码的“编码代理”。其他主要实验室迅速跟进，推出了自己的命令行界面（CLI）和异步基于网络的编码代理，这些代理因其安全性和并行任务执行能力而备受重视。LLM还在命令行上得到了广泛采用，像Claude Code这样的工具实现了10亿美元的年收入运行率，简化了复杂的Unix命令。然而，代理中普遍使用的“YOLO”（自动确认）模式引发了安全担忧，这被称为“异常常态化”。\n\n由于高级代理的大量token消耗，每月200美元的新订阅层级（例如Claude Pro Max、ChatGPT Pro）应运而生。至关重要的是，像DeepSeek和Qwen这样的中国AI实验室在开源模型排行榜上异军突起，发布了与顶尖西方产品媲美、通常是开源的强大模型，引发了短暂的市场重新评估。LLM在处理“长任务”方面也取得了巨大进展，能够完成数小时的软件工程项目，而提示驱动的图像编辑则成为了一款非常成功的消费产品。"

    "summary": "Warren Buffett has stepped down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway after six decades, handing control of the $1-trillion conglomerate to Greg Abel. Buffett will remain chairman and plans daily office visits, offering advice to Abel. Abel, who has managed Berkshire's non-insurance operations since 2018, now faces the challenge of navigating slowing growth and pressure to strategically deploy the company's $382-billion cash pile.\n\nBuffett transformed Berkshire from a struggling textile mill into an investment powerhouse, consistently outperforming the S&P 500 with holdings like Geico, BNSF, Coca-Cola, and Apple. However, Berkshire's immense size now makes finding significantly impactful acquisitions difficult.\n\nWhile Berkshire's decentralized culture is expected to endure, analysts anticipate Abel will bring a more hands-on leadership approach. He has already initiated leadership changes, including appointing NetJets CEO Adam Johnson to manage consumer, service, and retail businesses, creating a third division. Abel will oversee manufacturing, utility, and railroad sectors.\n\nAbel will eventually face investor pressure to initiate dividends or traditional stock buybacks if the large cash reserve isn't productively utilized, though Buffett's substantial voting power will initially provide insulation. Despite recent executive departures, including Todd Combs and CFO Marc Hamburg, Berkshire's diverse and robust subsidiaries provide a solid foundation, leaving long-term shareholders optimistic about its future under Abel.",

    "summary": "Austin Z. Henley, an Associate Teaching Professor at Carnegie Mellon University, has announced the cancellation of his traditional book deal. Initially hesitant, he signed with a major publisher in early 2023 to write a book based on his popular blog posts about \"classic programming projects.\" His concept was a collection of tutorials on building fun, self-contained projects like a compiler or a 2D game, teaching fundamental computing concepts.\n\nDespite a low $5,000 advance and modest royalties, Henley pursued the project as a personal goal. However, the writing process was fraught with challenges. He frequently missed deadlines and encountered editorial pressure to \"dumb down\" the content, suppress his personal voice, and conform to a formulaic technical book style. He also firmly rejected the publisher's repeated attempts to mandate AI integration, viewing it as antithetical to the book's core premise.\n\nAs the process became a \"chore,\" Henley lost motivation. Combined with personal life events like his wedding and doubts about the book's relevance in the age of AI, he decided to freeze the project. The contract was eventually terminated, and all rights reverted to him. Henley still believes in the book idea and is now self-publishing it, with an e-book available for pre-order and chapters released as they're completed, followed by a print version.",

This \"faster heart\" significantly enhances the speed and overall health of the entire F-Droid ecosystem.\n\nThe upgrade faced delays due to global supply chain challenges and difficulty in sourcing reliable components, but F-Droid prioritized finding a robust, long-term solution. A unique aspect of the new setup is its physical hosting by a trusted, long-time contributor, rather than a generic data center. This special arrangement ensures transparency, control, and aligns with F-Droid's values and security model.\n\nThe previous server, 12 years old, had become a maintenance burden. The new system shows dramatic performance improvements; app publishing frequency has accelerated from every 3-4 days (January-September) to daily in November and twice daily in December. This significantly shortens the gap between app updates and user access, allowing for more efficient build cycles.\n\nF-Droid emphasizes that these crucial infrastructure upgrades are a direct result of community support.
