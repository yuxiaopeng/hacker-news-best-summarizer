    "title": "Antirender: remove the glossy shine on architectural renderings",
    "url": "https://antirender.com/",
    "summary": "The concept of \"Antirender\" proposes a method to consciously **remove the glossy shine from architectural renderings**. This approach directly challenges the prevalent aesthetic in architectural visualization, which often favors highly polished, idealized, and sometimes unrealistic presentations.\n\nThe core purpose of Antirender, as encapsulated by the slogan \"See Through The Architectural BS,\" is to strip away superficiality. It suggests that the excessive gloss and perfection commonly depicted in renderings can obscure a project's true nature, potentially creating a misleading or overly optimistic impression. By eliminating this artificial sheen, Antirender aims to foster a more authentic, transparent, and grounded understanding of architectural designs.\n\nUltimately, Antirender is not just about a visual alteration; it's a critical statement advocating for realism and honesty in architectural representation, encouraging viewers to look beyond the surface perfection to assess the genuine qualities and potential realities of a proposed building or space.",
    "chinese_title": "反渲染：去除建筑效果图的高光",
    "chinese_summary": "“Antirender”的概念提出了一种方法，旨在自觉地去除建筑渲染图中光泽闪亮的表面效果。这种方法直接挑战了建筑可视化领域中流行的美学，这种美学常偏爱高度抛光、理想化，有时甚至是脱离现实的呈现方式。\n\nAntirender 的核心宗旨，正如其口号“看穿建筑界的扯淡 (See Through The Architectural BS)”所概括的，在于剥离其表面性。它认为，渲染图中普遍存在的过度光泽和完美无缺，可能掩盖项目的真实本质，潜在地造成误导或过于乐观的印象。通过消除这种人工光泽，Antirender 旨在促进对建筑设计更真实、透明和脚踏实地的理解。\n\n归根结底，Antirender 不仅仅是关于视觉上的改变；它是一种批判性声明，倡导建筑表现的真实性和诚实性，鼓励观者超越表面的完美，以评估拟议建筑或空间的真实品质和潜在现实。"

    "url": "https://an.dywa.ng/carrier-gnss.html",
    "summary": "Mobile carriers can obtain your precise GPS location, not merely an approximate one from cell towers. While cell tower data offers accuracy in tens to hundreds of meters, cellular standards like 2G/3G's Radio Resources LCS Protocol (RRLP) and 4G/5G's LTE Positioning Protocol (LPP) enable networks to silently request and receive highly accurate GNSS (GPS, GLONASS, etc.) coordinates from devices. These \"control-plane\" protocols are invisible to end users.\n\nThis capability, though not widely publicized, has been used by government agencies. Examples include the US DEA obtaining GPS data via phone \"pings\" in 2006, and Israel's Shin Bet tracking all cellular phones using triangulation and GPS, evident from its precise application in COVID-19 contact tracing. The author stresses that GNSS is inherently passive, meaning devices don't need to transmit location data to determine it; these protocols force the transmission.\n\nApple's iOS 26.3, due in 2026, will introduce a privacy feature limiting \"precise location\" data available to cellular networks via cell towers for devices with its new in-house modem. However, the author argues this is insufficient, urging Apple to allow users to disable GNSS location responses to carriers and notify them of such attempts, citing concerns about potential exploitation by state actors.",
    "chinese_title": "移动运营商可以获取你的GPS定位",
    "chinese_summary": "移动运营商可以获取您精确的GPS位置，而不仅仅是蜂窝基站提供的近似位置。虽然蜂窝基站数据提供几十到几百米的精度，但2G/3G的无线资源LCS协议（RRLP）和4G/5G的LTE定位协议（LPP）等蜂窝标准使网络能够静默地从设备请求并接收高度精确的GNSS（GPS、GLONASS等）坐标。这些“控制平面”协议对终端用户是不可见的。\n\n尽管这项能力并未广泛宣传，但已被政府机构使用。例如，2006年美国缉毒局（DEA）通过电话“ping”获取GPS数据，以及以色列国家安全局（Shin Bet）利用三角测量和GPS追踪所有手机，这从其在COVID-19接触者追踪中的精确应用中可见一斑。作者强调，GNSS本质上是被动的，这意味着设备无需传输位置数据即可确定自身位置；而这些协议强制设备传输位置数据。\n\n苹果将于2026年发布的iOS 26.3将引入一项隐私功能，限制搭载其新款自研调制解调器的设备通过蜂窝基站向蜂窝网络提供“精确位置”数据。然而，作者认为这还不够，敦促苹果允许用户禁用对运营商的GNSS位置响应，并在运营商尝试获取时通知用户，同时引用了对国家行为者潜在利用的担忧。"

    "summary": "Finland is exploring an Australia-style ban on social media for children under 15, building on the success of mobile phone restrictions in schools. Since August, Finnish schools like FISTA have banned phones during school hours, reporting increased student activity, creativity, and social interaction.\n\nPrime Minister Petteri Orpo supports a social media ban for under-15s, citing concerns about children's escalating physical inactivity. Public support is growing, with two-thirds of Finns backing the ban, a significant jump from last summer.\n\nResearcher Silja Kosola describes uncontrolled social media as an \"uncontrolled human experiment,\" linking it to rising self-harm, eating disorders, and diverging values between young boys and girls. She highlights Finland's unique context, where 95% of first-graders owned smartphones just a few years ago.\n\nAustralia implemented a ban for under-16s on December 10, driven by a mother's letter linking her daughter's suicide to social media. The law places the burden on companies, imposing substantial fines for non-compliance. Early Australian indicators are positive, though communication and household-level enforcement are crucial.\n\nHowever, an Australian living in Helsinki, Seona Candy, warns Finland against a \"reactive\" ban, noting that children might simply migrate to unregulated platforms. She suggests Finland instead leverage its world-renowned education system to invest in digital education, literacy, and safety for children.",

    "summary": "The provided content is only a title: \"NetBird - Open Source Zero Trust Networking.\" As there is no accompanying article text to summarize, this response will provide a summary based on general knowledge of NetBird and Zero Trust Networking.\n\nNetBird is an open-source platform designed to implement Zero Trust Networking principles, creating secure, private overlay networks. At its core, Zero Trust operates on the principle of \"never trust, always verify,\" meaning no user or device is inherently trusted, regardless of its location. NetBird applies this by establishing secure, encrypted connections (often leveraging WireGuard) directly between devices, bypassing traditional perimeter-based security models like VPNs.\n\nThis enables organizations to provide granular, identity-centric access to resources, whether they are in the cloud, on-premises, or at remote locations. Key benefits include an enhanced security posture through micro-segmentation, simplified network access for remote workforces, and the ability to connect disparate infrastructure components seamlessly. Being open source, NetBird offers transparency, auditability, and the flexibility for self-hosting the control plane, empowering users with greater control and reducing vendor lock-in. It aims to simplify the deployment and management of secure, distributed networks for the modern IT environment.",

    "url": "https://simedw.com/2026/01/31/ear-pronunication-via-ctc/",
    "summary": "The author developed a deep learning-based Computer-Assisted Pronunciation Training (CAPT) system to fix their Mandarin tones, finding previous pitch visualization attempts too brittle. Embracing the \"bitter lesson\" of learned representations, they built an on-device system to provide precise feedback.\n\nThe architecture features a Conformer encoder, which combines CNNs for local phonetic details (e.g., `zh` vs `z`) and Transformers for global tonal context (e.g., tone sandhi). Crucially, it uses Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss, preventing the model from auto-correcting errors and instead forcing it to predict what was *actually* said, frame by frame. Forced alignment, powered by the Viterbi algorithm, then determines the exact timing of each syllable. Unique tokenization treats each Pinyin syllable with its tone (e.g., `zhong1` vs `zhong4`) as a distinct entity, making tone errors explicit.\n\nTrained on ~300 hours of transcribed speech (AISHELL-1 and Primewords), the model was successfully shrunk from 75M to 9M parameters with minimal accuracy loss (98.29% tone accuracy, 5.27% TER), suggesting it's data-bound. The 37MB FP32 model was further quantized to 11MB INT8 for browser-based deployment. A critical bug involving silent frames skewing confidence scores was fixed by filtering out blank predictions during scoring.\n\nThe author notes significant pronunciation improvement, though native speakers find the model overly strict, likely due to a domain shift from the read speech in training data to casual conversation. Children also struggle due to different pitch characteristics and underrepresentation in datasets. Future work involves adding conversational datasets like Common Voice. A live demo, running entirely in the browser, is available.",
    "chinese_title": "展示 HN: 我训练了一个900万参数的语音模型来纠正我的普通话声调",
