    "url": "https://blog.tomaszdunia.pl/grapheneos-eng/",
    "summary": "This article details the author's transition from the Apple ecosystem to GrapheneOS, a privacy and security-focused custom Android-based operating system. Initially breaking from Apple with a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 rental, the author's renewed interest in Android led to discovering GrapheneOS, spurred by concerns about government attempts to compromise user privacy.\n\nGrapheneOS is an open-source, AOSP-based system prioritizing privacy by eliminating Google services at the system level, while allowing them to run in an isolated sandbox. It features advanced security hardening and exclusively supports Google Pixel devices, leveraging their dedicated security chips (like Titan M) and Verified Boot for comprehensive protection.\n\nThe author chose a Google Pixel 9a for its cost-effectiveness and long-term support, acknowledging a slight compromise in camera quality compared to their previous high-end devices.\n\nThe installation process, guided by a web-based installer, involves preparing the phone, unlocking the bootloader, flashing the GrapheneOS system image, and critically, re-locking the bootloader to enable full Verified Boot functionality, which prevents unauthorized system modifications.\n\nThe author's vision for using GrapheneOS emphasizes privacy and control: utilizing additional user profiles for app compartmentalization, acquiring open-source applications through platforms like Obtainium and Aurora Store, exercising granular control over app permissions, and creating a \"private space\" for sensitive apps. The article concludes by encouraging support for the GrapheneOS project.",
    "chinese_title": "GrapheneOS —— 摆脱谷歌和苹果",
    "chinese_summary": "本文详细介绍了作者从苹果生态系统转向GrapheneOS（一个专注于隐私和安全的定制化安卓操作系统）的过程。作者最初通过租赁一台三星Galaxy Z Fold 6脱离了苹果，这重新激发了他对安卓的兴趣，并促使他发现了GrapheneOS，其背后是对政府试图侵犯用户隐私的担忧。\n\nGrapheneOS是一个开源的、基于AOSP的系统，它通过在系统层面消除谷歌服务来优先保护隐私，同时允许这些服务在隔离的沙盒中运行。该系统具有先进的安全强化功能，并且独家支持谷歌Pixel设备，利用其专用的安全芯片（如Titan M）和“已验证启动”（Verified Boot）功能提供全面的保护。\n\n作者选择了一款谷歌Pixel 9a手机，原因是其性价比和长期支持，尽管作者也承认，与之前使用的高端设备相比，Pixel 9a的摄像头质量略有妥协。\n\n在一个基于网络的安装程序的指导下，安装过程包括准备手机、解锁引导加载程序（bootloader）、刷入GrapheneOS系统镜像，以及至关重要地，重新锁定引导加载程序，以启用完整的“已验证启动”（Verified Boot）功能，从而防止未经授权的系统修改。\n\n作者对GrapheneOS的使用愿景强调隐私和控制：利用额外的用户配置文件来实现应用隔离，通过Obtainium和Aurora Store等平台获取开源应用程序，对应用程序权限进行精细控制，以及为敏感应用创建“私密空间”。文章最后鼓励读者支持GrapheneOS项目。"

    "summary": "On February 18, 2026, Vincent Driessen, creator of the widely influential \"A successful Git branching model\" and its distinctive diagram from 2010, reported that Microsoft had published an AI-generated imitation of his work on their official Learn portal. Driessen had meticulously designed his original diagram, even sharing its source file, and had always been content with its widespread use for over 15 years as a means of sharing knowledge.\n\nHowever, he expressed dismay that Microsoft, without any credit or link to his original, had seemingly run his diagram through an AI image generator. He criticized Microsoft's version as \"ugly,\" \"careless,\" and \"blatantly amateuristic,\" highlighting flaws like missing arrows, incorrect directions, and the obvious AI artifact \"continvoucly morged.\"\n\nThe poor quality and clear plagiarism led many to recognize the original work and call out Microsoft, prompting them to contact Driessen. While appreciative of the public's support and the ensuing meme, Driessen found the situation \"saddening.\" His concern wasn't the use of his diagram itself, but the \"lack of process and care\"—taking carefully crafted work, running it through a machine to remove \"fingerprints,\" and publishing an inferior version as their own. He worried about the future of AI-generated content masking plagiarism more effectively. Driessen requested simple attribution and transparency regarding Microsoft's content creation and proofreading processes.",

    "url": "https://fortune.com/2026/02/17/ai-productivity-paradox-ceo-study-robert-solow-information-technology-age/",
    "summary": "Robert Solow's 1987 observation of a productivity paradox—where IT advancements didn't immediately translate into economic growth—is seemingly recurring with Artificial Intelligence. Despite substantial corporate AI investments and frequent mentions by S&P 500 companies, broader productivity gains are not yet evident.\n\nA recent NBER study of 6,000 executives revealed most saw minimal AI impact on operations, with average usage at just 1.5 hours weekly for those adopting it. Nearly 90% reported no impact on employment or productivity over three years. Apollo's chief economist, Torsten Slok, notes AI is \"everywhere except in the incoming macroeconomic data,\" including employment, productivity, and profit margins outside the Magnificent Seven.\n\nWhile some studies, like MIT's 2023 research, showed AI significantly boosting worker performance, other findings are more modest. A 2024 MIT study projected a \"disappointing\" 0.5% productivity increase over a decade. Reasons for this gap include persistent worker distrust in AI's utility and companies like IBM prioritizing human hires for future leadership pipelines.\n\nHowever, economists suggest this pattern could reverse, mirroring the IT boom's eventual productivity surge in the 1990s. Erik Brynjolfsson and Mohamed El-Erian see early signs of an AI-driven productivity jump, with GDP and job growth decoupling. Slok envisions a \"J-curve\" effect: an initial slowdown followed by exponential growth.\n\nUnlike past IT, AI tools are now readily accessible due to fierce competition. Therefore, future AI productivity depends not just on the technology itself, but critically on \"how generative AI is used and implemented in different sectors in the economy.\"",
    "chinese_title": "AI采纳与索洛生产力悖论",
    "chinese_summary": "罗伯特·索洛在1987年提出的“生产力悖论”——即信息技术（IT）进步并未立即转化为经济增长——似乎正在人工智能（AI）领域重演。尽管企业在人工智能方面投入巨资，标准普尔500指数公司也频繁提及AI，但更广泛的生产力提升尚未显现。\n\n国家经济研究局（NBER）近期对6000名高管进行的一项研究显示，大多数人认为AI对运营的影响微乎其微，采纳AI的高管平均每周仅使用1.5小时。近90%的人表示，在过去三年中，AI对就业或生产力没有影响。阿波罗全球管理公司首席经济学家托斯滕·斯洛克指出，人工智能“无处不在，除了宏观经济数据中”，这包括“七巨头”之外的就业、生产力和利润率数据。\n\n尽管一些研究，例如麻省理工学院2023年的研究，表明AI显著提升了员工绩效，但其他研究结果则更为保守。麻省理工学院2024年的一项研究预测，未来十年生产力将“令人失望地”仅增长0.5%。造成这一差距的原因包括员工对AI实用性的持续不信任，以及IBM等公司优先招聘人类以培养未来的领导人才。\n\n然而，经济学家认为这种模式可能会逆转，类似于20世纪90年代信息技术繁荣最终带来的生产力激增。埃里克·布林约尔夫森和穆罕默德·埃尔-埃里安看到了AI驱动生产力飞跃的早期迹象，即GDP增长与就业增长脱钩。斯洛克设想了一种“J型曲线”效应：初期放缓，随后是指数级增长。\n\n与过去的信息技术不同，由于激烈的竞争，AI工具现在已唾手可得。因此，未来的AI生产力不仅取决于技术本身，更关键在于“生成式AI如何在经济的不同部门中被使用和实施”。"

    "url": "https://www.sceneandheardnu.com/content/halt-and-catch-fire",
    "summary": "*Halt and Catch Fire* is an underrated television drama, hailed by the author as one of TV's best, despite its low viewership when it debuted in 2014. Initially, Season 1 struggled by adopting AMC's antihero formula, focusing too heavily on the \"mediocre, overconfident\" Joe MacMillan, which made the narrative feel familiar and emotionally disengaging.\n\nHowever, the show bravely reinvented itself after its first season, shifting its focus away from Joe's antihero arc. It evolved into a deeply empathetic ensemble study, particularly highlighting the \"burgeoning business partnership\" between female protagonists Donna and Cameron. The article praises this partnership as one of television's best portrayals of female friendship, granting its characters nuanced agency and complexity. The show explores how all its characters — Joe, Gordon, Cameron, and Donna — grow, learn, and confront the limits of their ambitions, ultimately understanding the necessity of human connection.\n\nThe article emphasizes the show's obsession with change and reinvention, likened to \"recursion\" in computer science. Across four seasons, marked by time jumps and the rise and fall of companies, the narrative prioritizes process over results. It argues that while products are disposable, the desire for human connection and the act of creation endure. The series concludes not with an end, but an offer, underscoring its theme of continuous learning, new beginnings, and the cyclical nature of life. *Halt and Catch Fire* is recommended as a show that looks toward the future, currently streaming on Netflix.",
    "chinese_title": "奔腾年代：鲜为人知的电视最佳剧集 (2021)",
    "chinese_summary": "《奔腾年代》（*Halt and Catch Fire*）是一部被低估的电视剧，尽管它在2014年首播时收视率不高，但作者仍将其誉为电视史上最佳剧集之一。起初，该剧第一季因沿用AMC的反英雄模式而举步维艰，过于侧重于“平庸、自大”的乔·麦克米伦（Joe MacMillan），这使得叙事显得老套且缺乏情感共鸣。\n\n然而，该剧在第一季后勇敢地进行了自我革新，将焦点从乔的反英雄弧线转移。它演变成了一部深刻展现共情的群像剧，尤其着重描绘了女性主角唐娜（Donna）和卡梅隆（Cameron）之间“蓬勃发展的商业伙伴关系”。文章赞扬这种伙伴关系是电视上对女性友谊的最佳描绘之一，赋予角色细致入微的主动性和复杂性。该剧探讨了所有角色——乔、戈登（Gordon）、卡梅隆和唐娜——如何成长、学习并直面自身抱负的局限，最终理解了人际连接的必要性。\n\n文章强调该剧对变化和重塑的执着，将其比作计算机科学中的“递归”。在四季中，故事伴随着时间跳跃和公司的兴衰，叙事重心始终是过程而非结果。文章认为，产品是可抛弃的，但对人际连接的渴望和创造的行为却能持久不衰。剧集的结局并非终点，而是一种邀约，这突显了其持续学习、全新开始和生命循环的主题。《奔腾年代》被推荐为一部展望未来的剧集，目前正在Netflix上线。"
