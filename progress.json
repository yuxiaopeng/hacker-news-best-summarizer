    "title": "TikTok users can't upload anti-ICE videos. The company blames tech issues",
    "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/26/tech/tiktok-ice-censorship-glitch-cec",
    "summary": "TikTok users are reporting significant difficulties uploading videos critical of ICE, leading to accusations of censorship. Comedian Megan Stalter, after multiple failed attempts to post an anti-ICE video following the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti by federal agents, deleted her account, suspecting her content was being suppressed. Other prominent users, like nurse Jen Hamilton, also experienced upload problems, particularly with ICE-related content.\n\nTikTok attributes the issues to \"tech issues\" and a power outage at a US data center, denying any connection to recent events. However, these glitches coincided with TikTok's US assets transitioning to a new majority American-owned joint venture. This deal, influenced by the Trump administration, involves new investor Oracle, whose executive chair is a close affiliate of President Trump, and grants the new venture control over trust, safety, and content moderation policies.\n\nExperts, like technology ethics professor Casey Fiesler, find user skepticism understandable given the new ownership's political connections to the Trump administration and ICE. She notes widespread concerns among users about data access and potential changes in content recommendation, stating that even if not purposeful censorship, the perception erodes trust. Jeffrey Blevins, a media law professor, adds that TikTok, as a private platform, legally has the right to censor content.\n\nThe controversy has led to a spike in TikTok uninstalls. While some users are abandoning the platform, others are finding alternative ways, like \"speaking in code,\" to discuss sensitive topics, suspecting the difficulties are intended to silence dissenting narratives. The opacity of TikTok's algorithm makes proving intentional censorship incredibly challenging.",
    "chinese_title": "TikTok用户无法上传反ICE视频，该公司将其归咎于技术问题。",
    "chinese_summary": "TikTok用户报告称，上传批评美国移民及海关执法局（ICE）的视频遇到显著困难，这导致了审查指控。喜剧演员梅根·斯塔尔特（Megan Stalter）在联邦特工射杀亚历克斯·普雷蒂（Alex Pretti）后，多次尝试发布反ICE视频均失败，随后她删除了自己的账户，怀疑自己的内容遭到压制。其他知名用户，如护士詹·汉密尔顿（Jen Hamilton），也经历了上传问题，尤其是在涉及ICE内容时。\n\nTikTok将这些问题归因于“技术问题”和美国数据中心的停电，否认与近期事件有任何关联。然而，这些故障恰逢TikTok在美国的资产正向一家新的、由美国多数控股的合资企业过渡。这项受特朗普政府影响的交易，涉及新投资者甲骨文公司（Oracle），其执行董事长与特朗普总统关系密切，并赋予该新合资企业对信任、安全和内容审核政策的控制权。\n\n技术伦理学教授凯西·菲斯勒（Casey Fiesler）等专家认为，考虑到新所有权与特朗普政府及ICE的政治联系，用户的怀疑态度是可以理解的。她指出，用户普遍担心数据访问和内容推荐可能发生变化，并表示即使并非蓄意审查，这种看法也会侵蚀信任。媒体法教授杰弗里·布莱文斯（Jeffrey Blevins）补充说，TikTok作为私人平台，在法律上拥有审查内容的权利。\n\n这场争议导致TikTok卸载量激增。虽然一些用户正在放弃该平台，但另一些用户正在寻找替代方式，例如“隐晦表达”（speaking in code），来讨论敏感话题，他们怀疑这些困难旨在压制异议声音。TikTok算法的不透明性使得证明蓄意审查变得极其困难。"

    "url": "https://www.himthe.dev/blog/microsoft-to-linux",
    "summary": "The author, a long-time Windows user, software developer, and musician, was \"forced\" to switch to Linux due to mounting frustrations with Microsoft's operating system. What started with full-screen ads for Edge and OneDrive, escalated to non-consensual updates that closed apps and deleted unsaved work.\n\nThe breaking point was the Windows 24H2 update, which installed without permission and introduced a severe bug causing Chrome to have \"visual seizures\" and system lock-ups, later attributed to a Multiplane Overlay (MPO) issue between NVIDIA and Microsoft. Rollbacks failed, and even a clean reinstall or an Insider build didn't fully resolve the issues, leading to new problems like Chrome freezing during video playback. The author criticized Microsoft for its lack of actionable fixes, pervasive Copilot/OneDrive integration, and difficulty creating local accounts, concluding that Windows had become \"too much work\" and actively fought the user.\n\nDespite initial worries about app support, the author switched to CachyOS (Arch-based). While facing initial challenges like broken sleep mode and the lack of a native Ableton Live, solutions were found for NVIDIA issues and a native DAW (Bitwig Studio) was adopted. The author highlights that Linux now offers full support for major browsers, is the preferred platform for software development, excels in music production (thanks to PipeWire), and has significantly improved gaming compatibility and performance (Proton/Wine). While acknowledging some gaps in creative suites (Adobe, 3D modeling like Autodesk) and certain anti-cheat games, the author praises Linux's general responsiveness.\n\nThe article concludes that Microsoft's focus on profit over user satisfaction, its reliance on AI for code, and its push for resource-hungry React Native apps for core system functions have made Windows 11 a \"buggy, ad-ridden, bloated, slop-infested mess.\" The author asserts that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has inadvertently become the \"biggest Linux evangelist,\" driving users away from Windows and into the ready ecosystem of Linux.",
    "chinese_title": "微软逼我改用Linux",
    "chinese_summary": "作者是一位资深的Windows用户、软件开发者和音乐家，由于对微软操作系统日益增长的不满，他“被迫”转向了Linux。最初是Edge和OneDrive的全屏广告，随后升级为未经用户同意的更新，这些更新会关闭应用程序并删除未保存的工作。\n\n转折点是Windows 24H2更新，该更新未经许可自行安装，并引入了一个严重错误，导致Chrome出现“视觉抽搐”和系统死机，后来被归咎于NVIDIA和微软之间的多平面叠加（MPO）问题。回滚操作失败，即使是纯净重装或安装预览版也未能完全解决问题，反而导致了诸如Chrome在视频播放时卡顿等新问题。作者批评微软缺乏可操作的修复措施，无处不在的Copilot/OneDrive集成，以及创建本地账户的困难，最终认为Windows变得“太麻烦了”，并且积极对抗用户。\n\n尽管最初担心应用支持问题，作者还是转向了CachyOS（基于Arch）。虽然面临睡眠模式故障和缺乏原生Ableton Live等初期挑战，但NVIDIA问题找到了解决方案，并采用了原生的数字音频工作站（Bitwig Studio）。作者强调，Linux现在完全支持主流浏览器，是软件开发的优选平台，在音乐制作方面表现出色（得益于PipeWire），并且游戏兼容性和性能也得到了显著改善（Proton/Wine）。虽然承认在创意套件（Adobe、Autodesk等3D建模软件）和某些反作弊游戏方面存在一些空白，但作者仍赞扬了Linux整体的响应速度。\n\n文章总结称，微软将利润置于用户满意度之上，依赖人工智能编写代码，以及为核心系统功能推广资源密集型React Native应用程序的做法，已使Windows 11变成“一个充满漏洞、广告、臃肿、混乱不堪的烂摊子”。作者断言，微软首席执行官萨蒂亚·纳德拉无意中成为了“最大的Linux布道者”，将用户从Windows推向了成熟的Linux生态系统。"

    "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/fbi-investigating-minnesota-signal-minneapolis-group-ice-patel-kash-rcna256041",
    "summary": "FBI Director Kash Patel announced an FBI investigation into Signal group chats in Minnesota, where residents are sharing information about federal immigration agents' movements, including their locations and license plate numbers. Patel expressed concerns that these activities might put agents \"in harm's way\" or \"illegally entrap\" them, potentially violating federal law.\n\nThe investigation was launched after conservative journalist Cam Higby's viral X (Twitter) thread alleged that these groups were obstructing law enforcement. Patel stated that if the coordination in these chats leads to a federal statute violation, arrests would be made.\n\nThe probe immediately drew criticism from free speech advocates, including the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression and the Knight First Amendment Institute. They argue that the First Amendment protects the public's right to share legally obtained information about government officials and their activities to ensure accountability. While acknowledging free speech concerns, Patel said the FBI would \"balance\" First and Second Amendment rights with potential federal law violations, stressing that acts of violence or code breaches would not be tolerated.\n\nActivists in Minnesota use these encrypted chats, along with other tools, to warn families, particularly non-citizens, about Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations, especially near schools, motivated by a desire to protect their community. Patel did not initially specify which laws may have been violated. He also mentioned an ongoing investigation into groups funding immigration enforcement resistance, alleging the efforts are not \"organic.\"",

    "summary": "The U.S. federal government lost over 10,000 scientists and engineers with Ph.D.s during the first two years of the Trump administration, according to an analysis by the National Science Board (NSB). This represented a 15% reduction in the federal STEM Ph.D. workforce, dropping from 67,500 in January 2017 to 57,000 by January 2019.\n\nThe decline was observed across most federal agencies, with significant losses at the Departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs, Health and Human Services, and the Environmental Protection Agency. This trend stood in contrast to a slight increase in federal employees holding non-STEM Ph.D.s during the same period.\n\nWhile factors such as an initial hiring freeze and natural attrition to academia and the private sector contributed, the article suggests that a perceived hostility towards science and policy uncertainty under the administration also played a role. This \"brain drain\" raises concerns about the federal government's capacity to conduct vital research, inform policy decisions, and maintain essential scientific expertise in critical areas like public health, national security, and environmental protection. The NSB highlighted this trend to Congress, emphasizing the importance of a skilled federal workforce.",
