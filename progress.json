He humorously acknowledges the daily mistaken identity and the absence of a shared fortune with the tech mogul.\n\nThe website highlights the many inconveniences the lawyer Zuckerberg has faced due to his name: mistaken identity lawsuits, constant hacking attempts on his Facebook accounts, forced account deactivations, inundation with calls and emails related to Facebook scams, daily tech support requests, constant friend requests, suggestions for Facebook improvements, death threats and harassment via Messenger, and Venmo solicitations. He was even kicked off the Nextdoor app for using a \"fake name.\"\n\nDespite the constant confusion and occasional harassment, the Indiana Zuckerberg maintains a good-natured approach.
