    "url": "https://noheger.at/blog/2026/01/11/the-struggle-of-resizing-windows-on-macos-tahoe/",
    "summary": "The article criticizes macOS Tahoe's large window corner radius, not just for its aesthetics but primarily for creating a significant usability issue with window resizing. The author, after decades of computing, frequently experiences failed resize attempts.\n\nThis problem arises because the expected click target area for resizing (a 19x19 pixel zone near the corner) is now predominantly *outside* the visible window due to Tahoe's exaggerated curves. In contrast, older macOS versions had most of this target area *inside* the window corner.\n\nUsers instinctively try to grab the window corner *inside* the visible boundary, where they naturally expect a responsive handle. However, this intuitive click often falls outside the system's new, displaced target area and thus fails. Paradoxically, the most reliable way to resize a window in Tahoe is to click *outside* what visually appears to be the window's corner. This counter-intuitive gesture feels unnatural, leads to errors, and significantly detracts from the fundamental usability of window management.",
    "chinese_title": "macOS Tahoe 调整窗口大小的挣扎",
    "chinese_summary": "文章批评了 macOS Tahoe 窗口过大的圆角半径，这不仅仅是美观问题，更主要的是它造成了严重的窗口大小调整可用性问题。作者拥有数十年的计算经验，却经常遇到调整大小失败的情况。\n\n这个问题出现的原因是，由于 Tahoe 过于夸张的圆角，预期的调整大小点击目标区域（角落附近一个19x19像素的区域）现在主要位于可见窗口的 *外部*。相比之下，旧版 macOS 的该目标区域大部分都位于窗口角的 *内部*。\n\n用户会本能地尝试抓取可见边界 *内部* 的窗口角，因为他们自然期望在那里找到一个可操作的响应区域。然而，这种直观的点击却经常落在系统新的、被位移的目标区域之外，从而导致操作失败。矛盾的是，在 Tahoe 中调整窗口大小最可靠的方法是点击视觉上看起来是窗口角的 *外部*。这种反直觉的手势令人感觉不自然，导致错误，并极大地削弱了窗口管理的基本可用性。"

    "url": "https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview",
    "summary": "Anthropic has launched Cowork, a new research preview designed to extend Claude's capabilities beyond coding to assist anyone with their daily work. Developed after observing users adapting Claude Code for various non-coding tasks, Cowork offers a simpler, more integrated way to collaborate with Claude.\n\nAvailable initially for Claude Max subscribers on the macOS app, Cowork allows users to grant Claude access to a specific folder on their computer. With this access, Claude gains significant agency to read, edit, and create files within that folder. It can perform tasks such as organizing downloads, generating spreadsheets from images, or drafting reports from scattered notes, operating with a planned approach and keeping the user informed.\n\nCowork enhances productivity by integrating with existing Claude connectors and introducing new skills for creating documents and presentations. When paired with Claude in Chrome, it can also handle tasks requiring browser access. This system reduces the need for manual context updates and allows for parallel task processing, fostering a more natural, \"coworker-like\" interaction.\n\nUser control and safety are paramount. Users explicitly choose which folders and connectors Claude can access, and Claude seeks approval before executing significant actions. However, users are cautioned about the potential for destructive actions (like file deletion) if instructions are misinterpreted, and the ongoing risk of \"prompt injections.\" As a research preview, users are encouraged to experiment while taking necessary precautions. Future improvements will include cross-device sync, Windows support, and enhanced safety features.",
    "chinese_title": "协同工作：Claude 助您编写剩余代码",
    "chinese_summary": "Anthropic推出了Cowork，这是一个新的研究预览版，旨在将Claude的能力从编码扩展到协助任何人完成日常工作。该产品是在观察到用户将Claude Code用于各种非编码任务后开发的，Cowork提供了一种更简单、更集成的方式与Claude协作。\n\nCowork最初将面向macOS应用上的Claude Max订阅用户开放，它允许用户授予Claude访问其电脑上特定文件夹的权限。获得此权限后，Claude获得了在该文件夹内读取、编辑和创建文件的重要自主权。它能够执行诸如整理下载文件、从图片生成电子表格或从零散笔记起草报告等任务，并以有计划的方式运行，同时让用户随时了解进展。\n\nCowork通过与现有Claude连接器集成，并引入创建文档和演示文稿的新技能，从而提高生产力。当与Chrome浏览器中的Claude配对使用时，它还可以处理需要浏览器访问的任务。该系统减少了手动更新上下文的需要，并允许并行处理任务，从而促进了更自然、“像同事一样”的互动。\n\n用户控制和安全至关重要。用户明确选择Claude可以访问哪些文件夹和连接器，并且Claude在执行重要操作前会征求批准。然而，用户被提醒，如果指令被误解，可能会导致破坏性操作（如文件删除），并且存在持续的“提示注入”风险。作为一个研究预览版，鼓励用户在采取必要预防措施的同时进行实验。未来的改进将包括跨设备同步、支持Windows系统以及增强的安全功能。"

    "summary": "Apple has partnered with Google, selecting its Gemini models and cloud technology to power an AI-enabled Siri and other future Apple foundational models. The multiyear agreement, while undisclosed in financial terms, was reportedly valued at $1 billion annually by previous reports. Apple stated that Google's technology offers the \"most capable foundation\" for its AI initiatives, with models running on Apple devices and its private cloud compute.\n\nThis deal reinforces trust in Google's accelerating AI agenda, particularly after it recently surpassed Apple in market capitalization. Google already pays Apple billions to be the default search engine on iPhones. Apple has faced increasing pressure to advance its AI capabilities, having largely remained on the sidelines compared to other tech giants. An anticipated major Siri upgrade was previously delayed until 2026.\n\nDespite the new Google partnership, Apple currently integrates OpenAI's ChatGPT for complex Siri and Apple Intelligence queries. Apple has clarified it is not making immediate changes to its agreement with OpenAI, though the long-term implications are unclear. Following the news, shares for both companies saw an initial climb before pulling back.",

    "summary": "On January 11, 2026, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell announced that the Department of Justice served the Federal Reserve with grand jury subpoenas, threatening a criminal indictment against him. The alleged basis for this action relates to his testimony last June before the Senate Banking Committee concerning a multi-year renovation project of Federal Reserve office buildings.\n\nWhile affirming his respect for the rule of law, Powell characterized the DOJ's move as an \"unprecedented action\" and part of a broader context of \"administration's threats and ongoing pressure.\" He stated that the renovation project and his testimony are mere \"pretexts.\" Instead, Powell believes the threat of criminal charges is a direct consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on its assessment of economic conditions and public interest, rather than acceding to the President's preferences.\n\nPowell framed the situation as a fundamental challenge to the Fed's independence, questioning whether monetary policy will remain guided by evidence or be directed by political pressure and intimidation. He vowed to continue carrying out his duties with integrity, focusing solely on the Fed's mandate of price stability and maximum employment, despite the threats.",

    "summary": "Jordan Fulghum declares 2026 the \"Year of Self-hosting,\" made easier and fun by CLI agents like Claude Code. Previously deterred by complex configurations, the author highlights three converging factors: cheap, capable mini PCs (like the Beelink Mini N150), secure networking with Tailscale, and intelligent CLI agents.\n\nClaude Code, installed directly on the Linux server, acts as a personal sysadmin. Instead of googling intricate Docker commands or config formats, users simply describe what they want (e.g., \"Set up Docker,\" \"Install Vaultwarden behind Caddy,\" \"Persist data properly\"), and the agent handles the implementation.\n\nThe author details a simple setup: install Ubuntu Server, Tailscale, then SSH in and install Claude Code. He successfully deployed services like Vaultwarden (password manager), Plex (media), Immich (Google Photos replacement), Uptime Kuma (monitoring), Caddy (reverse proxy), Home Assistant, and Readeck (read-it-later) – all containerized and easily managed. Claude Code also built a custom monitoring dashboard and automated both local and cost-effective remote backups to AWS S3.\n\nThis approach transforms self-hosting from a stressful maintenance task into an empowering and enjoyable experience, offering a strong sense of ownership and independence. The article recommends it to terminal-comfortable, software-literate individuals who use SaaS tools but wish to avoid becoming infrastructure experts, emphasizing that self-hosting is now not just viable, but genuinely fun.",

    "url": "https://blog.smartere.dk/2026/01/floppy-disks-the-best-tv-remote-for-kids/",
    "summary": "The article describes a DIY project to create a tangible TV remote for a 3-year-old using floppy disks, addressing the issue of modern TV interfaces being overly complex and disempowering for children. The author aimed to build a system that allows his son independent control, physical interaction, and the illusion of physically stored media, while avoiding auto-play.\n\nRejecting initial ideas like RFID tags, the author successfully implemented actual data storage on floppy disks (\"autoexec.sh\" on track 0), leveraging their nostalgic mechanical sounds. Technical challenges included reliably detecting disk insertion (solved by modifying the drive with a rolling switch, as the \"Disk Change\" pin was unreliable), reading disk data with an AVR-based Arduino (using the Arduino FDC Floppy library), and integrating an ESP-based board for WiFi communication to control a Chromecast.\n\nPowering the system with 18650 batteries presented significant hurdles due to high current spikes during disk spin-up, causing microcontroller resets. These were resolved with a capacitor, careful ground isolation, and setting logic pins to high impedance. The ATmega manages the overall flow, waking the ESP to send commands (like \"diskin\" for play, \"diskout\" for pause, or specific video commands) to a netcat|bash server controlling the Chromecast.\n\nThe 3-year-old quickly embraced the system, enjoying the tactile interaction and making his own choices. Damage to disks was mitigated by moving the read head to an unused track after reading. The project elicited mixed reactions in the comments, with some criticizing it as replacing parenting, while others lauded it for fostering independence, critical thinking, and technical curiosity.",

This \"Selective Temporal Training\" (STT) involves training models from scratch, rather than fine-tuning modern pre-trained models, ensuring an authentic historical perspective.\n\nThe project has progressed through several versions:\n*   **v0** (187MB data) produced incoherent but era-accurate language.\n*   **v0.5** (435MB data) significantly improved grammar and style, though factual hallucination and OCR noise persisted.\n*   **v1** (6.25GB data) was the first to recall and connect real historical events and figures.\n*   **v2mini-evals** (15GB sample of a 90GB dataset) experienced tokenization issues but demonstrated continued challenges with factual accuracy, even with well-known figures like Charles Darwin.\n\nThe training data consists of 1800-1875 London texts—books, legal documents, and newspapers—with dataset sizes growing up to 90GB. A crucial step involves building a custom tokenizer from this historical data. The project's primary focus is on curating this unique dataset and building the tokenizer, with users directed to frameworks like nanoGPT for the core LLM training process.",
