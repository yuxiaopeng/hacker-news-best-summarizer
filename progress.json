    "summary": "The author, frustrated by a loud individual watching reels at Bombay airport, created a small app called \"STFU\" (Stolen from @TimDarcet, originally \"make-it-stop\"). Unable to confront the person directly or find polite requests effective, the author developed an application that records ambient audio and plays it back with a ~2-second delay.\n\nThe app, built with help from Claude AI and the Web Audio API, surprisingly proved effective in making noisy people quiet down. The author speculates its success might be due to an auditory feedback loop or cognitive dissonance, although admits to not being a neuroscientist. Created out of \"spite,\" the app serves as a practical, albeit unconventional, solution to common public disturbances. The author encourages others to use it as they see fit and links to a discussion on X (formerly Twitter) about the project.",

    "chinese_summary": "作者在孟买机场被一个大声刷短视频的人惹恼，于是开发了一款名为“STFU”的小应用（这个名字借用自@TimDarcet，原意是“让它停止”）。由于无法直接与那个人对峙，也无法通过礼貌请求解决问题，作者开发了一款应用，它能录下周围环境的声音，并以大约2秒的延迟播放出来。\n\n这款应用在Claude AI和Web Audio API的帮助下构建，令人惊讶的是，它在让吵闹的人安静下来方面非常有效。作者推测其成功可能归因于听觉反馈循环或认知失调，尽管他承认自己不是神经科学家。这款应用是出于“报复心”而创建的，它为常见的公共滋扰提供了一个实用但非传统的解决方案。作者鼓励其他人酌情使用它，并链接到了X（前身为Twitter）上关于该项目的讨论。"

    "summary": "Cloudflare has acquired The Astro Technology Company, the company behind the popular Astro web framework. All full-time Astro employees will now join Cloudflare, continuing their work on the framework.\n\nAstro will remain open-source, MIT-licensed, actively maintained, and continue supporting a wide array of deployment targets, not exclusively Cloudflare. Its open governance model and current roadmap will also stay intact.\n\nBorn in 2021, Astro aimed to build performant, content-driven websites, counteracting the trend of heavy, application-centric web architectures. While gaining significant traction—nearly 1,000,000 weekly downloads and adoption by major companies—attempts to build a business around hosted primitives proved unsuccessful and became a distraction from core framework development.\n\nThis acquisition unifies Cloudflare's infrastructure-side vision (global, fast, secure platform) with Astro's framework-side vision (easy-to-build, fast-by-default sites). Cloudflare, a long-time open-source supporter, will provide the resources needed for Astro to refocus entirely on innovation and code. The team can now dedicate 100% of their efforts to enhancing the framework, with upcoming releases like Astro 6 slated to improve performance, scale, and reliability for web content delivery.",

    "chinese_summary": "Cloudflare 已收购 Astro 技术公司，该公司是广受欢迎的 Astro 网络框架的幕后公司。所有 Astro 全职员工现在将加入 Cloudflare，继续他们在该框架上的工作。\n\nAstro 将保持开源、MIT 许可、积极维护，并继续支持广泛的部署目标，而不仅仅是 Cloudflare。其开放治理模式和当前路线图也将保持不变。\n\nAstro 诞生于 2021 年，旨在构建高性能、内容驱动的网站，以对抗臃肿、以应用程序为中心的网络架构趋势。尽管获得了显著关注——每周近 100 万次下载并被主要公司采用——但围绕托管原语构建业务的尝试被证明不成功，并分散了核心框架开发的精力。\n\n此次收购将 Cloudflare 的基础设施端愿景（全球、快速、安全的平台）与 Astro 的框架端愿景（易于构建、默认快速的网站）结合起来。作为长期以来的开源支持者，Cloudflare 将为 Astro 提供所需的资源，使其能够完全专注于创新和代码。该团队现在可以百分之百地投入到框架的增强中，Astro 6 等即将发布的版本旨在改进网络内容交付的性能、可扩展性和可靠性。"

    "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Germany_balloon_escape",
    "summary": "On September 16, 1979, eight people from two East German families, the Strelzyks and Wetzels, made a daring escape into West Germany using a homemade hot air balloon. Facing the heavily fortified inner German border, Peter Strelzyk and Günter Wetzel began planning in March 1978, inspired by a television program.\n\nTheir elaborate plan involved over a year and a half of preparations. They struggled to source large quantities of fabric without raising suspicion, acquiring materials from various distant towns. Numerous prototypes and test flights failed due to issues like porous fabric or insufficient burner power. Wetzel nearly abandoned the project, but Strelzyk persevered, discovering a more efficient way to use propane.\n\nIn July 1979, the Strelzyk family made a first, solo escape attempt. Their balloon descended prematurely, just 180 meters short of the border, forcing them to hike back undetected. The abandoned balloon was discovered by East German authorities (Stasi), intensifying the families' urgency to try again before they were caught.\n\nWorking quickly, the families built a third, larger balloon, 20 meters in diameter. On September 15, 1979, all eight individuals launched. Despite a small fire during takeoff and a tear in the balloon mid-flight that repeatedly extinguished the burner, Wetzel managed to relight it each time. After a 28-minute flight, reaching altitudes of 2,500 meters, they landed safely near Naila, Bavaria, in West Germany, with only Wetzel sustaining a broken leg.\n\nEast Germany reacted by increasing border security and restricting materials suitable for balloon construction. Strelzyk's brother and sister were arrested and imprisoned for aiding the escape, later released with Amnesty International's help. The families initially settled in Naila, with the Strelzyks eventually returning to their hometown after German reunification.",

    "summary": "Briar is a decentralized messaging application designed for activists, journalists, and anyone needing secure and resilient communication. Unlike conventional messengers, it operates without a central server, syncing messages directly between devices.\n\nA key feature is its ability to function without internet access, connecting users via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi Direct to ensure communication flow during crises. When the internet is available, Briar uses the Tor network, including \"bridges,\" to protect user privacy from surveillance and bypass censorship.\n\nAvailable on Android, users create a local-only account; there's no cloud backup, meaning forgotten passwords or app deletion result in data loss. Contacts can be added remotely via shared links or securely in person by scanning QR codes. All communications are end-to-end encrypted.\n\nBriar offers various communication features: private one-on-one messaging, private groups (where the creator manages invitations), and public forums (where any member can invite others). It also includes a personal blog feature, automatically shared with contacts, and an RSS feed reader to privately access news via Tor.\n\nSettings allow users to customize themes, control Tor connection methods (with or without bridges), manage mobile data usage, and enable a screen lock for app security. Briar's dual capability of offline local connectivity and online privacy via Tor makes it a robust tool for maintaining connections in challenging environments.",

Crash reporting is generally left enabled where it's a separate option. While browsers may display a \"managed by an organization\" message due to these policies, the settings are persistent and can be customized or removed.
